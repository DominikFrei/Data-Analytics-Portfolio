  # P1 Lead Discovery against P. falciparum
  
  ## Abstract
  The contents of the ChEMBL Database were explored using MySQL, with the goal of finding promising leads for a drug against 
  P.falciparum (Malaria pathogen). Then an available qHTS (quantitative high throughput screening) assay (assay_id = 752407) was selected to be investigated more closely.
  Finally certain data were extracted from the database in order to create a dashboard in Tableau, which gives more information on 86 compounds, that showed 
  a low AC50 value in this assay. The information on the dashboard includes: activity of the respective compounds on other targets, information about 
  approval and research status, if the respective compounds comply with Lipinski's Rule of Five and the Rule of Three for "Lead-Like" compounds
