"1","008578","DARAPRIM (pyrimethamine) is an antiparasitic compound available in tablet form for oral administration. Each scored tablet contains 25 mg pyrimethamine and the inactive ingredients corn and potato starch, lactose, and magnesium stearate.Pyrimethamine, known chemically as 5-(4- chlorophenyl)-6-ethyl-2, 4-pyrimidinediamine, has the following structural formula:C12H13CIN4         
Mol. Wt. 248.71","DESCRIPTION SECTION"
"2","008578","Pyrimethamine is well absorbed with peak levels occurring between 2 to 6 hours following administration. It is eliminated slowly and has a plasma half-life of approximately 96 hours. Pyrimethamine is 87% bound to human plasma proteins.","CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION"
"3","008578","Microbiology: Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist and the rationale for its therapeutic action is based on the differential requirement between host and parasite for nucleic acid precursors involved in growth. This activity is highly selective against Toxoplasma gondii.
The action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides. This was demonstrated by Eyles and Coleman1 in the treatment of experimental toxoplasmosis in the mouse. Jacobs et al2 demonstrated that combination of the 2 drugs effectively prevented the development of severe uveitis in most rabbits following the inoculation of the anterior chamber of the eye with toxoplasma.","MICROBIOLOGY SECTION"
"4","008578","Treatment of Toxoplasmosis: DARAPRIM is indicated for the treatment of toxoplasmosis when used conjointly with a sulfonamide, since synergism exists with this combination. For Treatment of Toxoplasmosis: The dosage of DARAPRIM for the treatment of toxoplasmosis must be carefully adjusted so as to provide maximum therapeutic effect and a minimum of side effects. At the dosage required, there is a marked variation in the tolerance to the drug. Young patients may tolerate higher doses than older individuals. Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended in all patients.The adult starting dose is 50 to 75 mg of the drug daily, together with 1 to 4 g daily of a sulfonamide of the sulfapyrimidine type, e.g. sulfadoxine. This dosage is ordinarily continued for 1 to 3 weeks, depending on the response of the patient and tolerance to therapy. The dosage may then be reduced to about one half that previously given for each drug and continued for an additional 4 to 5 weeks. The pediatric dosage of DARAPRIM is 1 mg/kg/day divided into 2 equal daily doses; after 2 to 4 days this dose may be reduced to one half and continued for approximately 1 month. The usual pediatric sulfonamide dosage is used in conjunction with DARAPRIM.","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"
"5","008578","Use of DARAPRIM is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pyrimethamine or to any component of the formulation. Use of the drug is also contraindicated in patients with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency.","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"6","008578","The dosage of pyrimethamine required for the treatment of toxoplasmosis has a narrow therapeutic window. If signs of folate deficiency develop (see ADVERSE REACTIONS), reduce the dosage or discontinue the drug according to the response of the patient. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered in a dosage of 5 to 15 mg daily (orally, IV, or IM) until normal hematopoiesis is restored. Data in 2 humans indicate that pyrimethamine may be carcinogenic; a 51-year-old female who developed chronic granulocytic leukemia after taking pyrimethamine for 2 years for toxoplasmosis3 and a 56-year-old patient who developed reticulum cell sarcoma after 14 months of pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis.4
Pyrimethamine has been reported to produce a significant increase in the number of lung tumors in mice when given intraperitoneally at doses of 25 mg/kg.5
DARAPRIM should be kept out of the reach of infants and children as they are extremely susceptible to adverse effects from an overdose. Deaths in pediatric patients have been reported after accidental ingestion.","WARNINGS SECTION"
"7","008578","General: A small ""starting"" dose for toxoplasmosis is recommended in patients with convulsive disorders to avoid the potential nervous system toxicity of pyrimethamine. DARAPRIM should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function or in patients with possible folate deficiency, such as individuals with malabsorption syndrome, alcoholism, or pregnancy, and those receiving therapy, such as phenytoin, affecting folate levels (see Pregnancy subsection).","GENERAL PRECAUTIONS SECTION"
"8","008578","Information for Patients: Patients should be warned that at the first appearance of a skin rash they should stop use of DARAPRIM and seek medical attention immediately. Patients should also be warned that the appearance of sore throat, pallor, purpura, or glossitis may be early indications of serious disorders which require treatment with DARAPRIM to be stopped and medical treatment to be sought. Women of childbearing potential who are taking DARAPRIM should be warned against becoming pregnant Patients should be warned to keep DARAPRIM out of the reach of children. Patients should be advised not to exceed recommended doses. Patients should be warned that if anorexia and vomiting occur, they may be minimized by taking the drug with meals. Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended when used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis in all patients.","INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS SECTION"
"9","008578","Laboratory Tests: In patients receiving high dosage, semiweekly blood counts, including platelet counts, should be performed.","LABORATORY TESTS SECTION"
"10","008578","Drug Interactions: Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine and other antimalarials, and with other antibiotics. However, the concomitant use of other antifolic drugs or agents associated with myelosuppression including sulfonamides or trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole combinations, proguanil, zidovudine, or cytostatic agents (e.g., methotrexate), while the patient is receiving pyrimethamine, may increase the risk of bone marrow suppression. If signs of folate deficiency develop, pyrimethamine should be discontinued. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored (see WARNINGS). Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients when lorazepam and pyrimethamine were administered concomitantly.","DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION"
"11","008578","Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: See WARNINGS section for information on carcinogenesis.Mutagenesis: Pyrimethamine has been shown to be nonmutagenic in the following in vitro assays: the Ames point mutation assay, the Rec assay, and the E. coli WP2 assay. It was positive in the L5178Y/ TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation.6 Human blood lymphocytes cultured in vitro had structural chromosome aberrations induced by pyrimethamine. In vivo, chromosomes analyzed from the bone marrow of rats dosed with pyrimethamine showed an increased number of structural and numerical aberrations.","CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY SECTION"
"12","008578","Pregnancy:Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Pyrimethamine has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in oral doses 2.5 times the human dose for treatment of toxoplasmosis. At these doses in rats, there was a significant increase in abnormalities such as cleft palate, brachygnathia, oligodactyly, and microphthalmia. Pyrimethamine has also been shown to produce terata such as meningocele in hamsters and cleft palate in miniature pigs when given in oral doses 5 times the human dose for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. DARAPRIM should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended when used during pregnancy.","PREGNANCY SECTION"
"13","008578","Nursing Mothers: Pyrimethamine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from pyrimethamine and from concurrent use of a sulfonamide with DARAPRIM for treatment of some patients with toxoplasmosis, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy).","NURSING MOTHERS SECTION"
"14","008578","Pediatric Use: See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.","PEDIATRIC USE SECTION"
"15","008578","Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of DARAPRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.","GERIATRIC USE SECTION"
"16","008578","Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally severe (such as Stevens- Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and anaphylaxis), and hyperphenylalaninemia, can occur particularly when pyrimethamine is administered concomitantly with a sulfonamide. Consult the complete prescribing information for the relevant sulfonamide for sulfonamide-associated adverse events. With doses of pyrimethamine used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, anorexia and vomiting may occur. Vomiting may be minimized by giving the medication with meals; it usually disappears promptly upon reduction of dosage. Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, atrophic glossitis, hematuria, and disorders of cardiac rhythm.Hematologic effects, however, may also occur at low doses in certain individuals (see PRECAUTIONS; General).Pulmonary eosinophilia has been reported rarely.","ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION"
"17","008578","Following the ingestion of 300 mg or more of pyrimethamine, gastrointestinal and/or central nervous system signs may be present, including convulsions. The initial symptoms are usually gastrointestinal and may include abdominal pain, nausea, severe and repeated vomiting, possibly including hematemesis. Central nervous system toxicity may be manifest by initial excitability, generalized and prolonged convulsions which may be followed by respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, and death within a few hours. Neurological symptoms appear rapidly (30 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion), suggesting that in gross overdosage pyrimethamine has a direct toxic effect on the central nervous system.The fatal dose is variable, with the smallest reported fatal single dose being 375 mg. There are, however, reports of pediatric patients who have recovered after taking 375 to 625 mg.There is no specific antidote to acute pyrimethamine poisoning. In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. Gastric lavage is recommended and is effective if earned out very soon after drug ingestion. Parenteral diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Folinic acid should be administered within 2 hours of drug ingestion to be most effective in counteracting the effects on the hematopoietic system (see WARNINGS). Due to the long half-life of pyrimethamine, daily monitoring of peripheral blood counts is recommended for up to several weeks after the overdose until normal hematologic values are restored.","OVERDOSAGE SECTION"

The chemical name for hydroxychloroquine sulfate is 2-[[4-[(7-Chloro-4-quinolyl) amino]pentyl] ethylamino]ethanol sulfate (1:1). Its structural formula is:The molecular weight of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is 433.95, and molecular formula is C18H26ClN3O.H2SO4.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets contain 200 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate, equivalent to 155 mg base, and are for oral administration.Inactive Ingredients: Dibasic calcium phosphate USP, hypromellose USP, magnesium stearate NF, polyethylene glycol 400 NF, polysorbate 80 NF, corn starch, titanium dioxide USP, carnauba wax NF, shellac NF, black iron oxide NF.","DESCRIPTION SECTION"
"24","009768","Pharmacokinetics: Following a single 200 mg oral dose of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets to healthy males, the mean peak blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine was 129.6 ng/mL, reached in 3.26 hours with a half-life of 537 hours (22.4 days). In the same study, the plasma peak concentration was 50.3 ng/mL reached in 3.74 hours with a half-life of 2963 hours (123.5 days). Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. The mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74. After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, significant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) have been found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite. The absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days. The long half-life can be attributed to extensive tissue uptake rather than through decreased excretion. Peak plasma levels of hydroxychloroquine were seen in about 3 to 4 hours. Renal clearance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for at least six months seemed to be similar to that of the single dose studies in volunteers, suggesting that no change occurs with chronic dosing. Range for renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16 to 30% and did not correlate with creatinine clearance; therefore, a dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment. In RA patients, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity. Cellular levels of patients on daily hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be higher in mononuclear cells than polymorphonuclear leucocytes.","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"
"25","009768","Mechanism of action: The precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine, like chloroquine, is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.Mechanism of action: The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are unknown.","MECHANISM OF ACTION SECTION"
"26","009768","Activity in vitro and in Clinical Infections: Hydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium vivax. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite stage (P. vivax and P. ovale) of the Plasmodium parasites.Drug Resistance: P. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine.Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE – Malaria).Patients in whom chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia, or patients who acquired malaria in a geographic area where chloroquine resistance is known to occur should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE – Malaria and WARNINGS).Hepatic/Renal Disease: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. A reduction in dosage may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease, as well as in those taking medicines known to affect these organs.Hematologic Effects/Laboratory Tests: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. Periodic blood cell counts should be performed if patients are given prolonged therapy. If any severe blood disorder such as aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, appears which is not attributable to the disease under treatment, consider discontinuation of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should be administered with caution in patients having glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency.Dermatologic Effects: Dermatologic reactions to Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may occur and, therefore, proper care should be exercised when it is administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis.Please reference the How Supplied section listed above for a description of individual tablets.This drug product has been received by Aphena Pharma - TN in a manufacturer or distributor packaged configuration and repackaged in full compliance with all applicable cGMP regulations.The package configurations available from Aphena are listed below:Count200mg6043353-051-539043353-051-6018043353-051-80900043353-051-09Store between 20°-25°C (68°-77°F).

"30","009768","Resistant strains of malaria: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology).Ocular: Irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Significant risk factors for retinal damage include daily doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of some concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate and concurrent macular disease.A baseline ocular examination is recommended within the first year of starting Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. The baseline exam should include: best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT).For individuals with significant risk factors (daily dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 5.0 mg/kg base of actual body weight, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of tamoxifen citrate or concurrent macular disease) monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For individuals without significant risk factors, annual exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment.In individuals of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.It is recommended that hydroxychloroquine be discontinued if ocular toxicity is suspected and the patient should be closely observed given that retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may progress even after cessation of therapy.Cardiac Effects, including Cardiomyopathy and QT prolongation: Postmarketing cases of life-threatening and fatal cardiomyopathy have been reported with use of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets as well as with use of chloroquine. Patients may present with atrioventricular block, pulmonary hypertension, sick sinus syndrome or with cardiac complications. ECG findings may include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block. Signs or symptoms of cardiac compromise have appeared during acute and chronic treatment. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy is advised, including use of appropriate diagnostic tools such as ECG to monitor patients for cardiomyopathy during Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets therapy. Chronic toxicity should be considered when conduction disorders (bundle branch block/atrio-ventricular heart block) or biventricular hypertrophy are diagnosed. If cardiotoxicity is suspected, prompt discontinuation of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may prevent life-threatening complications.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolong the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes have been reported in patients taking Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets (see OVERDOSAGE). Therefore, Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval (see DRUG INTERACTIONS).Worsening of psoriasis and porphyria: Use of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe attack of psoriasis. When used in patients with porphyria the condition may be exacerbated. The preparation should not be used in these conditions unless in the judgment of the physician the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible hazard.Proximal Myopathy and Neuropathy: Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have been associated with curvilinear bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.Neuropsychiatric events, including suicidality: Suicidal behavior has been rarely reported in patients treated with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.Hypoglycemia: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets have been shown to cause severe hypoglycemia including loss of consciousness that could be life threatening in patients treated with or without antidiabetic medications (see DRUG INTERACTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients treated with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should be warned about the risk of hypoglycemia and the associated clinical signs and symptoms. Patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during treatment with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should have their blood glucose checked and treatment reviewed as necessary.","WARNINGS SECTION"

"33","009768","Digoxin: Concomitant Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels: serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving combined therapy.Insulin or antidiabetic drugs: As Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may be required.Drugs that prolong QT interval and other arrhythmogenic drugs: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolong the QT interval and should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Also, there may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs.Mefloquine and other drugs known to lower the convulsive threshold: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can lower the convulsive threshold. Co-administration of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of convulsions.Antiepileptics: The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co-administered with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.Methotrexate: Combined use of methotrexate with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects.Cyclosporin: An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets were co-administered.The following interactions have been observed on treatment with the structurally related substance chloroquine phosphate, and therefore cannot be ruled out for hydroxychloroquine.Praziquantel: Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel.Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed.Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided.Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin.","DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION"
"34","009768","Information for Patients: Patients should be informed of the early signs and symptoms of toxicity such as rash or visual changes.

"39","009768","Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.","GERIATRIC USE SECTION"
"40","009768","The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets or other 4-aminoqunoline compounds. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Bone marrow failure, anemia, aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Hemolysis reported in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency.Cardiac disorders: Cardiomyopathy which may result in cardiac failure and in some cases a fatal outcome (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE).

"41","009768","The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion, and in accidental overdosage, or rarely with lower doses in hypersensitive patients, toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes. The symptoms of overdosage may include headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest. Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt. Immediate gastric lavage until the stomach is completely emptied is indicated. After lavage, activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube within 30 minutes of ingestion of the drug may inhibit further intestinal absorption. To be effective, the dose of activated charcoal should be at least five times the estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine ingested.Consideration should be given to administering diazepam parenterally since studies suggest that it may be beneficial in reversing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity.Respiratory support and shock management should be instituted as necessary.Exchange transfusions are used to reduce the level of 4-aminoquinoline drug in the blood.A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least six hours. Fluids may be forced and sufficient ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine. This will promote urinary excretion in cases of both overdosage and sensitivity. However, caution must be exercised in patients with impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis.","OVERDOSAGE SECTION"

"46","020500","MEPRON oral suspension is indicated for the prevention of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in adults and adolescents (aged 13 years and older) who cannot tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). MEPRON oral suspension is indicated for the acute oral treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP in adults and adolescents (aged 13 years and older) who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX.Clinical experience with MEPRON for the treatment of PCP has been limited to subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP (alveolar-arterial oxygen diffusion gradient [(A-a)DO2] =45 mm Hg). Treatment of more severe episodes of PCP with MEPRON has not been studied. The efficacy of MEPRON in subjects who are failing therapy with TMP-SMX has also not been studied.The recommended oral dosage is 1,500 mg (10 mL) once daily administered with food.The recommended oral dosage is 750 mg (5 mL) twice daily (total daily dose = 1,500 mg) administered with food for 21 days.Administer MEPRON oral suspension with food to avoid low plasma atovaquone concentrations that may limit response to therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
MEPRON Foil Pouch•Open each 5-mL pouch by folding along the dotted line and tearing open at horizontal slit as directed by arrow on pouch.•For a 5-mL dose, take entire contents either by placing directly into the mouth or by dispensing into a dosing spoon (5 mL) or cup prior to administration by mouth. •For a 10-mL dose, take the entire contents of 2 pouches.MEPRON BottleShake bottle gently before administering the recommended dosage.Absorption of orally administered MEPRON oral suspension is limited but can be significantly increased when the drug is taken with food. Failure to administer MEPRON oral suspension with food may result in lower plasma atovaquone concentrations and may limit response to therapy. Consider therapy with other agents in patients who have difficulty taking MEPRON oral suspension with food or in patients who have gastrointestinal disorders that may limit absorption of oral medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes, and fatal liver failure have been reported in patients treated with atovaquone [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
If treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, closely monitor patients following administration of MEPRON.Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.Additionally, because many subjects who participated in clinical trials with MEPRON had complications of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse reactions caused by MEPRON from those caused by underlying medical conditions.PCP Prevention TrialsIn 2 clinical trials, MEPRON oral suspension was compared with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV-1–infected adolescent (13 to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or a prior episode of PCP) and unable to tolerate TMP-SMX. Dapsone Comparative Trial: In the dapsone comparative trial (n = 1,057), the majority of subjects were white (64%), male (88%), and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization (73%); the mean age was 38 years. Subjects received MEPRON oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 536) or dapsone 100 mg once daily (n = 521); median durations of exposure were 6.7 and 6.5 months, respectively. Adverse reaction data were collected only for adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment, which occurred at similar frequencies in subjects treated with MEPRON oral suspension or dapsone (Table 1). Among subjects taking neither dapsone nor atovaquone at enrollment (n = 487), adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in 43% of subjects treated with dapsone and 20% of subjects treated with MEPRON oral suspension. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting) were more frequently reported in subjects treated with MEPRON oral suspension (Table 1).Table 1.

Subjects received MEPRON oral suspension once daily at a dose of 750 mg (n = 188) or 1,500 mg (n = 175) or received aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg every 4 weeks (n = 186); the median durations of exposure were 6.2, 6.0, and 7.8 months, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by =20% of the subjects receiving either the 1,500-mg dose of MEPRON oral suspension or aerosolized pentamidine. Rash occurred more often in subjects treated with MEPRON oral suspension (46%) than in subjects treated with aerosolized pentamidine (28%). Treatment-limiting adverse reactions occurred in 25% of subjects treated with MEPRON oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily and in 7% of subjects treated with aerosolized pentamidine. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving MEPRON oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily were rash (6%), diarrhea (4%), and nausea (3%). The most frequent adverse reaction requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving aerosolized pentamidine was bronchospasm (2%).Table 2.

PCP Treatment TrialsSafety information is presented from 2 clinical efficacy trials of the MEPRON tablet formulation: 1) a randomized, double-blind trial comparing MEPRON tablets with TMP-SMX in subjects with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and mild-to-moderate PCP [(A-a)DO2] =45 mm Hg and PaO2 =60 mm Hg on room air; 2) a randomized, open-label trial comparing MEPRON tablets with intravenous (IV) pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials.TMP-SMX Comparative Trial: In the TMP-SMX comparative trial (n = 408), the majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Subjects received MEPRON 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or TMP 320 mg plus SMX 1,600 mg 3 times daily for 21 days; median durations of exposure were 21 and 15 days, respectively.Table 3 summarizes all clinical adverse reactions reported by =10% of the trial population regardless of attribution. Nine percent of subjects who received MEPRON and 24% of subjects who received TMP-SMX discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction. Among the subjects who discontinued, 4% of subjects receiving MEPRON and 8% of subjects in the TMP-SMX group discontinued therapy due to rash. The incidence of adverse reactions with MEPRON oral suspension at the recommended dose (750 mg twice daily) was similar to that seen with the tablet formulation.Table 3.

Pentamidine Comparative Trial: In the pentamidine comparative trial (n = 174), the majority of subjects in the primary therapy trial population (n = 145) were white (72%) and male (97%); the mean age was 37 years. Subjects received MEPRON 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or a 3- to 4-mg/kg single pentamidine isethionate IV infusion daily for 21 days; the median durations of exposure were 21 and 14 days, respectively.Table 4 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by =10% of the primary therapy trial population regardless of attribution. Fewer subjects who received MEPRON reported adverse reactions than subjects who received pentamidine (63% vs. 72%). However, only 7% of subjects discontinued treatment with MEPRON due to adverse reactions, while 41% of subjects who received pentamidine discontinued treatment for this reason. Of the 5 subjects who discontinued therapy with MEPRON, 3 reported rash (4%). Rash was not severe in any subject. The most frequently cited reasons for discontinuation of pentamidine therapy were hypoglycemia (11%) and vomiting (9%).Table 4.

One subject (1%) receiving MEPRON had elevated creatinine and BUN levels and 1 subject (1%) had elevated amylase levels. In this trial, elevated levels of amylase occurred in subjects (8% versus 4%) receiving MEPRON tablets or pentamidine, respectively.The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of MEPRON oral suspension. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Blood and Lymphatic System DisordersMethemoglobinemia, thrombocytopenia.Immune System DisordersHypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, bronchospasm, throat tightness, and urticaria.Eye DisordersVortex keratopathy.Gastrointestinal DisordersPancreatitis.Hepatobiliary DisordersHepatitis, fatal liver failure.Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue DisordersErythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and skin desquamation. Renal and Urinary DisordersAcute renal impairment.Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin and MEPRON oral suspension is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant administration of MEPRON oral suspension and rifampin or rifabutin is not recommended.Concomitant administration of tetracycline and MEPRON oral suspension has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be used when prescribing tetracycline concomitantly with MEPRON oral suspension. Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of MEPRON if coadministration is necessary.Metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised when prescribing MEPRON oral suspension with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir. Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of indinavir if coadministration with MEPRON oral suspension is necessary.Mechanism of ActionAtovaquone is a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an analog of ubiquinone, with antipneumocystis activity. The mechanism of action against Pneumocystis jirovecii has not been fully elucidated. In Plasmodium species, the site of action appears to be the cytochrome bc
1 complex (Complex III). Several metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone results in indirect inhibition of these enzymes. The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.Antimicrobial ActivityAtovaquone is active against P. jirovecii [see Clinical Studies (14)].ResistancePhenotypic resistance to atovaquone in vitro has not been demonstrated for P. jirovecii. However, in 2 subjects who developed PCP after prophylaxis with atovaquone, DNA sequence analysis identified mutations in the predicted amino acid sequence of P. jirovecii cytochrome b (a likely target site for atovaquone). The clinical significance of this is unknown.The indication for prevention of PCP is based on the results of 2 clinical trials comparing MEPRON oral suspension with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV-1–infected adolescent (aged 13 to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or a prior episode of PCP) and unable to tolerate TMP-SMX.Dapsone Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 1,057 subjects, randomized to receive MEPRON oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 536) or dapsone 100 mg once daily (n = 521). The majority of subjects were white (64%), male (88%), and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization (73%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 24 months. Subjects randomized to the dapsone arm who were seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii and had a CD4 count <100 cells/mm3 also received pyrimethamine and folinic acid. PCP event rates are shown in Table 7. Mortality rates were similar.Aerosolized Pentamidine Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 549 subjects, randomized to receive MEPRON oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 175), MEPRON oral suspension 750 mg once daily (n = 188), or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg once monthly (n = 186). The majority of subjects were white (79%), male (92%), and were primary prophylaxis patients at enrollment (58%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 11.3 months. The results of the PCP event rates appear in Table 7. Mortality rates were similar among the groups.Table 7. Confirmed or Presumed/Probable PCP Events (As-Treated Analysis)a

0.77(0.57, 1.04)1.47(0.86, 2.50)1.14(0.63, 2.06)An analysis of all PCP events (intent-to-treat analysis) for both trials showed results similar to those shown in Table 7. The indication for treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP is based on the results of 2 efficacy trials: a randomized, double-blind trial comparing MEPRON tablets with TMP-SMX in subjects with HIV/AIDS and mild-to-moderate PCP (defined in the protocol as [(A-a)DO2] =45 mm Hg and PaO2 =60 mm Hg on room air) and a randomized open-label trial comparing MEPRON tablets with IV pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials. Both trials were conducted with the tablet formulation using 750 mg 3 times daily. Results from these efficacy trials established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentrations and successful outcome. Successful outcome was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].TMP-SMX Comparative TrialThis double-blind, randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of MEPRON tablets with that of TMP-SMX for the treatment of subjects with HIV/AIDS and histologically confirmed PCP. Only subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP were eligible for enrollment.A total of 408 subjects were enrolled into the trial. The majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Eighty-six subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 322 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP, 160 were randomized to receive 750 mg MEPRON (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days and 162 were randomized to receive 320 mg TMP plus 1,600 mg SMX 3 times daily for 21 days. Therapy success was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Improvement in clinical and respiratory measures was assessed using a composite of parameters that included oral body temperature, respiratory rate, severity scores for cough, dyspnea, and chest pain/tightness. Therapy failures included lack of response, treatment discontinuation due to an adverse experience, and unevaluable.There was a significant difference (P = 0.03) in mortality rates between the treatment groups favoring TMP-SMX. Among the 322 subjects with confirmed PCP, 13 of 160 (8%) subjects treated with MEPRON and 4 of 162 (2.5%) subjects receiving TMP-SMX died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all 408 randomized subjects, there were 16 (8%) deaths among subjects treated with MEPRON and 7 (3.4%) deaths among subjects treated with TMP-SMX (P = 0.051). Of the 13 subjects with confirmed PCP and treated with MEPRON who died, 4 died of PCP and 5 died with a combination of bacterial infections and PCP; bacterial infections did not appear to be a factor in any of the 4 deaths among TMP-SMX-treated subjects.A correlation between plasma atovaquone concentrations and death demonstrated that subjects with lower plasma concentrations were more likely to die. For those subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentration data are available, 5 (63%) of 8 subjects with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 1 (2.0%) of the 49 subjects with Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations =5 mcg/mL died.Sixty-two percent of subjects on MEPRON and 64% of subjects on TMP-SMX were classified as protocol-defined therapy successes (Table 8).Table 8.

Approximately 80% of the subjects either had a history of intolerance to trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials (the primary therapy group) or were experiencing intolerance to TMP-SMX with treatment of an episode of PCP at the time of enrollment in the trial (the salvage treatment group). A total of 174 subjects were enrolled into the trial. Subjects were randomized to receive MEPRON 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or pentamidine isethionate 3- to 4-mg/kg single IV infusion daily for 21 days. The majority of subjects were white (72%) and male (97%); the mean age was approximately 37 years. Thirty-nine subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 135 subjects with histologically-confirmed PCP, 70 were randomized to receive MEPRON and 65 to pentamidine. One hundred and ten (110) of these were in the primary therapy group and 25 were in the salvage therapy group. One subject in the primary therapy group randomized to receive pentamidine did not receive trial medication.There was no difference in mortality rates between the treatment groups. Among the 135 subjects with confirmed PCP, 10 of 70 (14%) subjects receiving MEPRON and 9 of 65 (14%) subjects receiving pentamidine died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all subjects, there were 11 (12.5%) deaths among those treated with MEPRON and 12 (14%) deaths among those treated with pentamidine. Among subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations were available, 3 of 5 (60%) subjects with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 2 of 21 (9%) subjects with Day 4 plasma concentrations =5 mcg/mL died.

"63","020500","Risk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing experience with use of MEPRON in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations). Atovaquone given orally by gavage to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations at plasma concentrations up to 3 times and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations (see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of severe illness and maternal death associated with PCP compared with non-pregnant women.DataAnimal Data: Atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day [GD] 6 to GD15) did not cause maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma concentrations approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure during the treatment of PCP based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In pregnant rabbits, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 300, 600, and 1,200 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD18) caused decreased fetal body length at a maternally toxic dose of 1,200 mg/kg/day corresponding to a plasma concentration that is approximately 0.5 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In a pre- and post-natal study in rats, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from GD15 until Lactation Day (LD) 20 did not impair the growth or developmental effects in first generation offspring at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations during the treatment of PCP. Atovaquone crossed the placenta and was present in fetal rat and rabbit tissue. ","PREGNANCY SECTION"
"64","020500","Risk SummaryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1–infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1. There are no data on the presence of atovaquone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Atovaquone was detected in rat milk when lactating rats were administered oral atovaquone (see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the potential for HIV-1 transmission to HIV-negative infants, instruct mothers with HIV-1 not to breastfeed if they are taking MEPRON for the prevention or treatment of PCP.DataIn a rat study with doses of 10 and 250 mg/kg given orally by gavage on postpartum Day 11, atovaquone concentrations in the milk were 30% of the concurrent atovaquone concentrations in the maternal plasma at both doses. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.","LACTATION SECTION"

"71","020500","Plasma atovaquone concentrations do not increase proportionally with dose following ascending repeat-dose administration of MEPRON oral suspension in healthy subjects. When MEPRON oral suspension was administered with food at dosage regimens of 500 mg once daily, 750 mg once daily, and 1,000 mg once daily, mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentrations were 11.7 ± 4.8, 12.5 ± 5.8, and 13.5 ± 5.1 mcg/mL, respectively. The corresponding mean (±SD) Cmax concentrations were 15.1 ± 6.1, 15.3 ± 7.6, and 16.8 ± 6.4 mcg/mL.AbsorptionAtovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility. The mean (±SD) absolute bioavailability of atovaquone from a 750-mg dose of MEPRON oral suspension administered under fed conditions in 9 HIV-1–infected (CD4 >100 cells/mm3) volunteers was 47% ± 15%.Effect of Food: Administering MEPRON oral suspension with food enhances atovaquone bioavailability. Sixteen healthy subjects received a single 750-mg dose of MEPRON oral suspension after an overnight fast and following a meal (23 g fat: 610 kCal). The mean (±SD) atovaquone AUC under fasting and fed conditions were 324 ± 115 and 801 ± 320 h<U+25CF>mcg/mL, respectively, representing a 2.6 ± 1.0-fold increase.DistributionFollowing IV administration of atovaquone, the mean (±SD) volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 0.60 ± 0.17 L/kg (n = 9). Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. In 3 HIV-1–infected children who received 750 mg atovaquone as the tablet formulation 4 times daily for 2 weeks, the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of atovaquone were 0.04, 0.14, and 0.26 mcg/mL, representing less than 1% of the plasma concentration.EliminationThe mean (±SD) half-life of atovaquone was 62.5 ± 35.3 hours after IV administration and ranged from 67.0 ± 33.4 to 77.6 ± 23.1 hours following administration of MEPRON oral suspension.Metabolism: The metabolism of atovaquone is unknown.Excretion: Following oral administration of 14C-labelled atovaquone to healthy subjects, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days.Specific PopulationsPatients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.HIV-Infected Subjects: When MEPRON oral suspension was administered to 5 HIV-1–infected subjects at a dose of 750 mg twice daily, the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration was 21.0 ± 4.9 mcg/mL and mean (±SD) Cmax was 24.0 ± 5.7 mcg/mL. The mean (±SD) minimum plasma atovaquone concentration (Cmin) associated with the 750-mg twice-daily regimen was 16.7 ± 4.6 mcg/mL.In an open-label PCP trial in 18 HIV-1–infected subjects, administration of MEPRON oral suspension 750 mg twice daily with meals resulted in a mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration of 22.0 ± 10.1 mcg/mL.The mean (±SD) plasma clearance of atovaquone following IV administration in 9 HIV-1–infected subjects was 10.4 ± 5.5 mL/min (0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg).Drug Interaction StudiesRifampin/Rifabutin: In a trial with 13 HIV-1–infected volunteers, the oral administration of rifampin 600 mg every 24 hours with MEPRON oral suspension 750 mg every 12 hours resulted in a 52% ± 13% decrease in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 37% ± 42% increase in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma rifampin concentration. The half-life of atovaquone decreased from 82 ± 36 hours when administered without rifampin to 50 ± 16 hours with rifampin. In a trial of 24 healthy volunteers, the oral administration of rifabutin 300 mg once daily with MEPRON oral suspension 750 mg twice daily resulted in a 34% decrease in the mean steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 19% decrease in the mean steady-state plasma rifabutin concentration.Tetracycline: Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.Metoclopramide: Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with a 50% reduction in steady-state atovaquone plasma concentrations.Indinavir: Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir, but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI: 8%, 35%]).Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX): Concomitant administration of MEPRON oral suspension 500 mg once daily (not the approved dosage) and TMP-SMX in 6 HIV-infected adult subjects did not result in significant changes in either atovaquone or TMP-SMX exposure.Zidovudine: The administration of atovaquone tablets 750 mg every 12 hours with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours to 14 HIV-1–infected subjects resulted in a 24% ± 12% decrease in zidovudine apparent oral clearance, leading to a 35% ± 23% increase in plasma zidovudine AUC. The glucuronide metabolite:parent ratio decreased from a mean of 4.5 when zidovudine was administered alone to 3.1 when zidovudine was administered with atovaquone tablets. This effect is minor and would not be expected to produce clinically significant events. Zidovudine had no effect on atovaquone pharmacokinetics.","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"

Use with caution for the treatment of malaria in patients with severe renal impairment, only if the benefits of the 3-day treatment regimen outweigh the potential risks associated with increased drug exposure. No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]
Absorption of atovaquone may be reduced in patients with diarrhea or vomiting. If MALARONE is used in patients who are vomiting, parasitemia should be closely monitored and the use of an antiemetic considered. [See Dosage and Administration (2).] Vomiting occurred in up to 19% of pediatric patients given treatment doses of MALARONE. In the controlled clinical trials, 15.3% of adults received an antiemetic when they received atovaquone/proguanil and 98.3% of these patients were successfully treated. In patients with severe or persistent diarrhea or vomiting, alternative antimalarial therapy may be required.In mixed P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections, P. vivax parasite relapse occurred commonly when patients were treated with MALARONE alone.In the event of recrudescent P. falciparum infections after treatment with MALARONE or failure of chemoprophylaxis with MALARONE, patients should be treated with a different blood schizonticide.Elevated liver laboratory tests and cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation have been reported with prophylactic use of MALARONE.MALARONE has not been evaluated for the treatment of cerebral malaria or other severe manifestations of complicated malaria, including hyperparasitemia, pulmonary edema, or renal failure. Patients with severe malaria are not candidates for oral therapy.Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.Because MALARONE contains atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. The lower prophylactic doses of MALARONE were better tolerated than the higher treatment doses.Prophylaxis of P. falciparum MalariaIn 3 clinical trials (2 of which were placebo-controlled) 381 adults (mean age: 31 years) received MALARONE for the prophylaxis of malaria; the majority of adults were black (90%) and 79% were male. In a clinical trial for the prophylaxis of malaria, 125 pediatric patients (mean age: 9 years) received MALARONE; all subjects were black and 52% were male. Adverse experiences reported in adults and pediatric patients, considered attributable to therapy occurred in similar proportions of subjects receiving MALARONE or placebo in all studies. Prophylaxis with MALARONE was discontinued prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse experience in 3 of 381 (0.8%) adults and 0 of 125 pediatric patients.In a placebo-controlled study of malaria prophylaxis with MALARONE involving 330 pediatric patients (aged 4 to 14 years) in Gabon, a malaria-endemic area, the safety profile of MALARONE was consistent with that observed in the earlier prophylactic studies in adults and pediatric patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with MALARONE were abdominal pain (13%), headache (13%), and cough (10%). Abdominal pain (13% vs. 8%) and vomiting (5% vs. 3%) were reported more often with MALARONE than with placebo. No patient withdrew from the study due to an adverse experience with MALARONE. No routine laboratory data were obtained during this study.Non-immune travelers visiting a malaria-endemic area received MALARONE (n = 1,004) for prophylaxis of malaria in 2 active-controlled clinical trials. In one study (n = 493), the mean age of subjects was 33 years and 53% were male; 90% of subjects were white, 6% of subjects were black, and the remaining were of other racial/ethnic groups. In the other study (n = 511), the mean age of subjects was 36 years and 51% were female; the majority of subjects (97%) were white. Adverse experiences occurred in a similar or lower proportion of subjects receiving MALARONE than an active comparator (Table 3). Fewer neuropsychiatric adverse experiences occurred in subjects who received MALARONE than mefloquine. Fewer gastrointestinal adverse experiences occurred in subjects receiving MALARONE than chloroquine/proguanil. Compared with active comparator drugs, subjects receiving MALARONE had fewer adverse experiences overall that were attributed to prophylactic therapy (Table 3). Prophylaxis with MALARONE was discontinued prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse experience in 7 of 1,004 travelers.Table 3.

The mean duration of exposure was 23 days for MALARONE, 46 days for chloroquine, and 43 days for proguanil, reflecting the different recommended dosage regimens for these products. Fewer patients treated with MALARONE reported abdominal pain (2% vs. 7%) or nausea (<1% vs. 7%) than children who received chloroquine/proguanil. Oral ulceration (2% vs. 2%), vivid dreams (2% vs. <1%), and blurred vision (0% vs. 2%) occurred in similar proportions of patients receiving either MALARONE or chloroquine/proguanil, respectively. Two patients discontinued prophylaxis with chloroquine/proguanil due to adverse events, while none of those receiving MALARONE discontinued due to adverse events.Treatment of Acute, Uncomplicated P. falciparum MalariaIn 7 controlled trials, 436 adolescents and adults received MALARONE for treatment of acute, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The range of mean ages of subjects was 26 to 29 years; 79% of subjects were male. In these studies, 48% of subjects were classified as other racial/ethnic groups, primarily Asian; 42% of subjects were black and the remaining subjects were white. Attributable adverse experiences that occurred in =5% of patients were abdominal pain (17%), nausea (12%), vomiting (12%), headache (10%), diarrhea (8%), asthenia (8%), anorexia (5%), and dizziness (5%). Treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience in 4 of 436 (0.9%) adolescents and adults treated with MALARONE.In 2 controlled trials, 116 pediatric patients (weighing 11 to 40 kg) (mean age: 7 years) received MALARONE for the treatment of malaria. The majority of subjects were black (72%); 28% were of other racial/ethnic groups, primarily Asian. Attributable adverse experiences that occurred in =5% of patients were vomiting (10%) and pruritus (6%). Vomiting occurred in 43 of 319 (13%) pediatric patients who did not have symptomatic malaria but were given treatment doses of MALARONE for 3 days in a clinical trial. The design of this clinical trial required that any patient who vomited be withdrawn from the trial. Among pediatric patients with symptomatic malaria treated with MALARONE, treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience in 1 of 116 (0.9%).In a study of 100 pediatric patients (5 to <11 kg body weight) who received MALARONE for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, only diarrhea (6%) occurred in =5% of patients as an adverse experience attributable to MALARONE. In 3 patients (3%), treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience.Abnormalities in laboratory tests reported in clinical trials were limited to elevations of transaminases in patients with malaria being treated with MALARONE. The frequency of these abnormalities varied substantially across trials of treatment and were not observed in the randomized portions of the prophylaxis trials.One active-controlled trial evaluated the treatment of malaria in Thai adults (n = 182); the mean age of subjects was 26 years (range: 15 to 63 years); 80% of subjects were male. Early elevations of ALT and AST occurred more frequently in patients treated with MALARONE (n = 91) compared with patients treated with an active control, mefloquine (n = 91). On Day 7, rates of elevated ALT and AST with MALARONE and mefloquine (for patients who had normal baseline levels of these clinical laboratory parameters) were ALT 26.7% vs. 15.6%; AST 16.9% vs. 8.6%, respectively. By Day 14 of this 28-day study, the frequency of transaminase elevations equalized across the 2 groups.In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of MALARONE. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to MALARONE.Blood and Lymphatic System DisordersNeutropenia and anemia. Pancytopenia in patients with severe renal impairment treated with proguanil [see Contraindications (4.2)].Immune System DisordersAllergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and vasculitis.Nervous System DisordersSeizures and psychotic events (such as hallucinations); however, a causal relationship has not been established.Gastrointestinal DisordersStomatitis.Hepatobiliary DisordersElevated liver laboratory tests, hepatitis, cholestasis; hepatic failure requiring transplant has been reported.Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue DisordersPhotosensitivity, rash, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The concomitant administration of MALARONE and rifampin or rifabutin is not recommended.Proguanil may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarin-based anticoagulants. The mechanism of this potential drug interaction has not been established. Caution is advised when initiating or withdrawing malaria prophylaxis or treatment with MALARONE in patients on continuous treatment with coumarin-based anticoagulants. When these products are administered concomitantly, coagulation tests should be closely monitored.Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Parasitemia should be closely monitored in patients receiving tetracycline.While antiemetics may be indicated for patients receiving MALARONE, metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.Do not use MALARONE for malaria prophylaxis in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). Use with caution for the treatment of malaria in patients with severe renal impairment, only if the benefits of the 3-day treatment regimen outweigh the potential risks associated with increased drug exposure. No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]
No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No trials have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Mechanism of ActionThe constituents of MALARONE, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride, interfere with 2 different pathways involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines required for nucleic acid replication. Atovaquone is a selective inhibitor of parasite mitochondrial electron transport. Proguanil hydrochloride primarily exerts its effect by means of the metabolite cycloguanil, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor. Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase in the Plasmodium parasite disrupts deoxythymidylate synthesis.Antimicrobial ActivityAtovaquone and cycloguanil (an active metabolite of proguanil) are active against the erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. Enhanced efficacy of the combination compared with either atovaquone or proguanil hydrochloride alone was demonstrated in clinical trials in both immune and non-immune patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].ResistanceStrains of P. falciparum with decreased susceptibility to atovaquone or proguanil/cycloguanil alone can be selected in vitro or in vivo. The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride may not be effective for treatment of recrudescent malaria that develops after prior therapy with the combination.Genotoxicity studies have not been performed with atovaquone in combination with proguanil. Effects of MALARONE on male and female reproductive performance are unknown.AtovaquoneA 24-month carcinogenicity study in CD rats was negative for neoplasms at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 54 times the average steady-state plasma concentrations in humans during prophylaxis of malaria. In CD-1 mice, a 24-month study showed treatment-related increases in incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma at all doses tested (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day) which correlated with at least 15 times the average steady-state plasma concentrations in humans during prophylaxis of malaria.Atovaquone was negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay, and the cultured human lymphocyte cytogenetic assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.Atovaquone administered by oral gavage in doses of 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day to adult male rats from 73 days prior to mating until 20 days after mating and to adult female rats from 14 days prior to mating until LD20 did not impair male or female fertility or early embryonic development at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures of approximately 7.3 times the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC.ProguanilNo evidence of a carcinogenic effect was observed in 24-month studies conducted in CD-1 mice at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.5 times the average human plasma exposure during prophylaxis of malaria based on AUC, and in Wistar Hannover rats at doses up to 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.1 times the average human plasma exposure during prophylaxis of malaria based on AUC.Proguanil was negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay and the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.Cycloguanil, the active metabolite of proguanil, was also negative in the Ames test, but was positive in the mouse lymphoma assay and the mouse micronucleus assay. These positive effects with cycloguanil, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, were significantly reduced or abolished with folinic acid supplementation.Proguanil administered orally in doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg/kg/day to male rats from 29 days prior to mating until 27 days after mating and to females from 15 days prior to mating through GD7 revealed no adverse effects on adult male or female fertility or early embryonic development at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (up to 0.04 times the average human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC). Fertility studies of proguanil in animals at exposures similar to or greater than those observed in humans have not been conducted.Fibrovascular proliferation in the right atrium, pyelonephritis, bone marrow hypocellularity, lymphoid atrophy, and gastritis/enteritis were observed in dogs treated with proguanil hydrochloride for 6 months at a dose of 12 mg/kg/day (approximately 3.9 times the recommended daily human dose for malaria prophylaxis on a mg/m2 basis). Bile duct hyperplasia, gall bladder mucosal atrophy, and interstitial pneumonia were observed in dogs treated with proguanil hydrochloride for 6 months at a dose of 4 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.3 times the recommended daily human dose for malaria prophylaxis on a mg/m2 basis). Mucosal hyperplasia of the cecum and renal tubular basophilia were observed in rats treated with proguanil hydrochloride for 6 months at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.6 times the recommended daily human dose for malaria prophylaxis on a mg/m2 basis). Adverse heart, lung, liver, and gall bladder effects observed in dogs and kidney effects observed in rats were not shown to be reversible.MALARONE was evaluated for prophylaxis of P. falciparum malaria in 5 clinical trials in malaria-endemic areas and in 3 active-controlled trials in non-immune travelers to malaria-endemic areas.Three placebo-controlled trials of 10 to 12 weeks’ duration were conducted among residents of malaria-endemic areas in Kenya, Zambia, and Gabon. The mean age of subjects was 30 (range: 17 to 55), 32 (range: 16 to 64), and 10 (range: 5 to 16) years, respectively. Of a total of 669 randomized patients (including 264 pediatric patients aged 5 to 16 years), 103 were withdrawn for reasons other than falciparum malaria- or drug-related adverse events (55% of these were lost to follow-up and 45% were withdrawn for protocol violations). The results are listed in Table 6.Table 6. Prevention of Parasitemiaa in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials of MALARONE for Prophylaxis of P. falciparum Malaria in Residents of Malaria-Endemic Areasa Free of parasitemia during the 10- to 12-week period of prophylactic therapy.MALARONEPlaceboTotal number of patients randomized326343Failed to complete study5746Developed parasitemia (P. falciparum)292In another study, 330 Gabonese pediatric patients (weighing 13 to 40 kg and aged 4 to 14 years) who had received successful open-label radical cure treatment with artesunate, were randomized to receive either MALARONE (dosage based on body weight) or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. Blood smears were obtained weekly and any time malaria was suspected. Nineteen of the 165 children given MALARONE and 18 of 165 patients given placebo withdrew from the study for reasons other than parasitemia (primary reason was lost to follow-up). One out of 150 evaluable patients (<1%) who received MALARONE developed P. falciparum parasitemia while receiving prophylaxis with MALARONE compared with 31 (22%) of the 144 evaluable placebo recipients.In a 10-week study in 175 South African subjects who moved into malaria-endemic areas and were given prophylaxis with 1 MALARONE tablet daily, parasitemia developed in 1 subject who missed several doses of medication. Since no placebo control was included, the incidence of malaria in this study was not known.Two active-controlled trials were conducted in non-immune travelers who visited a malaria-endemic area. The mean duration of travel was 18 days (range: 2 to 38 days). Of a total of 1,998 randomized patients who received MALARONE or controlled drug, 24 discontinued from the study before follow-up evaluation 60 days after leaving the endemic area. Nine of these were lost to follow-up, 2 withdrew because of an adverse experience, and 13 were discontinued for other reasons. These trials were not large enough to allow for statements of comparative efficacy. In addition, the true exposure rate to P. falciparum malaria in both trials is unknown. The results are listed in Table 7.Table 7. Prevention of Parasitemiaa in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials of MALARONE for Prophylaxis of P. falciparum Malaria in Non-Immune Travelersa Free of parasitemia during the period of prophylactic therapy.MALARONEMefloquineChloroquine plus ProguanilTotal number of randomized patients who received study drug1,004483511Failed to complete study1464Developed parasitemia (P. falciparum)003A third randomized, open-label study was conducted which included 221 otherwise healthy pediatric patients (weighing =11 kg and aged 2 to 17 years) who were at risk of contracting malaria by traveling to an endemic area. The mean duration of travel was 15 days (range 1 to 30 days). Prophylaxis with MALARONE (n = 110, dosage based on body weight) began 1 or 2 days before entering the endemic area and lasted until 7 days after leaving the area. A control group (n = 111) received prophylaxis with chloroquine/proguanil dosed according to WHO guidelines. No cases of malaria occurred in either group of children. However, the study was not large enough to allow for statements of comparative efficacy. In addition, the true exposure rate to P. falciparum malaria in this study is unknown.Causal ProphylaxisIn separate trials with small numbers of volunteers, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride were independently shown to have causal prophylactic activity directed against liver-stage parasites of P. falciparum. Six patients given a single dose of atovaquone 250 mg 24 hours prior to malaria challenge were protected from developing malaria, whereas all 4 placebo-treated patients developed malaria.During the 4 weeks following cessation of prophylaxis in clinical trial participants who remained in malaria-endemic areas and were available for evaluation, malaria developed in 24 of 211 (11.4%) subjects who took placebo and 9 of 328 (2.7%) who took MALARONE. While new infections could not be distinguished from recrudescent infections, all but 1 of the infections in patients treated with MALARONE occurred more than 15 days after stopping therapy. The single case occurring on Day 8 following cessation of therapy with MALARONE probably represents a failure of prophylaxis with MALARONE.The possibility that delayed cases of P. falciparum malaria may occur sometime after stopping prophylaxis with MALARONE cannot be ruled out. Hence, returning travelers developing febrile illnesses should be investigated for malaria.In 3 Phase 2 clinical trials, atovaquone alone, proguanil hydrochloride alone, and the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride were evaluated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum. Among 156 evaluable patients, the parasitological cure rate (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) was 59/89 (66%) with atovaquone alone, 1/17 (6%) with proguanil hydrochloride alone, and 50/50 (100%) with the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride.MALARONE was evaluated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum in 8 Phase 3 randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials (N = 1,030 enrolled in both treatment groups). The mean age of subjects was 27 years and 16% were children 12 years and younger; 74% of subjects were male. Evaluable patients included those whose outcomes at 28 days were known. Among 471 evaluable patients treated with the equivalent of 4 MALARONE tablets once daily for 3 days, 464 had a sensitive response (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) (Table 8). Seven patients had a response of RI resistance (elimination of parasitemia but with recurrent parasitemia between 7 and 28 days after starting treatment). In these trials, the response to treatment with MALARONE was similar to treatment with the comparator drug in 4 trials.Table 8. Parasitological Response in 8 Clinical Trials of MALARONE for Treatment of P. falciparum Malariaa MALARONE = 1,000 mg atovaquone and 400 mg proguanil hydrochloride (or equivalent based on body weight for patients weighing =40 kg) once daily for 3 days.

Of the 23 patients in Thailand infected with P. vivax and treated with atovaquone/proguanil hydrochloride 1,000 mg/400 mg daily for 3 days, parasitemia cleared in 21 (91.3%) at 7 days. Parasite relapse occurred commonly when P. vivax malaria was treated with MALARONE alone. Relapsing malarias including P. vivax and P. ovale require additional treatment to prevent relapse.The efficacy of MALARONE in treating acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in children weighing =5 and <11 kg was examined in an open-label, randomized trial conducted in Gabon. Patients received either MALARONE (2 or 3 MALARONE pediatric tablets once daily depending upon body weight) for 3 days (n = 100) or amodiaquine (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 days (n = 100). In this study, the MALARONE tablets were crushed and mixed with condensed milk just prior to administration. An adequate clinical response (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) was obtained in 95% (87/92) of the evaluable pediatric patients who received MALARONE and in 53% (41/78) of those evaluable who received amodiaquine. A response of RI resistance (elimination of parasitemia but with recurrent parasitemia between 7 and 28 days after starting treatment) was noted in 3% and 40% of the patients, respectively. Two cases of RIII resistance (rising parasite count despite therapy) were reported in the patients receiving MALARONE. There were 4 cases of RIII in the amodiaquine arm.","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"

"99","021078","Risk SummaryAvailable data from published literature and postmarketing experience with use of MALARONE in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The proguanil component of MALARONE acts to inhibit parasitic dihydrofolate reductase; however, pregnant women and females of reproductive potential should continue folate supplementation to prevent neural tube defects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Pregnant women with malaria are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations).
Atovaquone administered by oral gavage to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not associated with fetal malformations at plasma exposures approximately 7 times and equal to, respectively, the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC. Proguanil administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not associated with embryo-fetal toxicity at maternally toxic plasma exposures approximately 0.07 and 0.8 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure for treatment of malaria based on AUC (see Data).The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride given orally by gavage during the period of organogenesis was not associated with embryo-fetal developmental effects in pregnant rats or rabbits at atovaquone:proguanil hydrochloride doses of 50:20 mg/kg/day and 100:40 mg/kg/day, respectively (1.7 and 0.1 times and 0.3 and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure for treatment of malaria). In a pre- and post-natal study with atovaquone and another pre-and post-natal study with proguanil, neither compound impaired the growth, development, or reproductive ability of first generation offspring at maternal AUC exposures of approximately 7.3 and 0.04 times, respectively, the estimated human AUC exposure for treatment of malaria (see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Malaria during pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal anemia, prematurity, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth.DataAnimal Data: Atovaquone: Atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (Gestation Day [GD] 6 to GD15) in pregnant rats did not cause maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma exposures up to 7.3 times the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC. In pregnant rabbits, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 300, 600, and 1,200 mg/kg/day by gavage during organogenesis (GD6 to GD18) was associated with decreased fetal body length at a maternally toxic dose of 1,200 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures that were approximately 1.3 times the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria based on AUC. In a pre- and post-natal study in rats, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from GD15 until Lactation Day (LD) 20 did not impair the growth or developmental effects in first generation offspring at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to AUC exposures of approximately 7.3 times the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria. Atovaquone crossed the placenta and was present in fetal rat and rabbit tissue.Proguanil: Proguanil administered orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis (GD6 to GD17) was not associated with fetal malformations, but increased ureter variations at a maternally toxic dose of 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to a plasma concentration approximately equal to 0.07 times the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC. Proguanil given orally by gavage at a maternally toxic dose of 40 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (GD6 to GD20) did not produce adverse embryo-fetal effects at a plasma concentration up to 0.8 times the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC. In a pre- and post-natal study in female rats, proguanil hydrochloride administered in oral doses of 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day from GD6 until LD20 did not impair the growth, development, or reproductive ability of first generation offspring or the survivability of second generation offspring at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (0.04 times the average human exposure based on AUC). Pre- and post-natal studies of proguanil in animals at exposures similar to or greater than those observed in humans have not been conducted.Atovaquone and Proguanil: The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride administered orally to pregnant rats in atovaquone:proguanil hydrochloride doses of 12.5:5, 25:10, and 50:20 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD17) did not produce maternal toxicity or adverse embryo-fetal developmental effects withdoses up to 50:20 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma concentrations up to 1.7 and 0.1 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria based on AUC. In pregnant rabbits, the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride administered orally in atovaquone:proguanil hydrochloride doses of 25:10, 50:20, or 100:40 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD20) did not produce adverse embryo-fetal developmental effects at a maternally toxic dose of 100:40 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma concentrations of approximately 0.3 and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria based on AUC.","PREGNANCY SECTION"
"100","021078","Risk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of atovaquone in human milk; however, proguanil is present in human milk. Atovaquone is present in rat milk (see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of atovaquone and proguanil on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for MALARONE and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed child from MALARONE or from the underlying maternal condition.DataIn a rat study with doses of 10 and 250 mg/kg, given orally by gavage on postpartum Day 11, atovaquone concentrations in the milk were 30% of the concurrent atovaquone concentrations in the maternal plasma at both doses.

"109","021078","AbsorptionAtovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility. The bioavailability of atovaquone shows considerable inter-individual variability.Effect of Food: MALARONE should be taken with food or a milky drink. Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting. The absolute bioavailability of the tablet formulation of atovaquone when taken with food is 23%.DistributionAtovaquone is highly protein bound (>99%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. A population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the apparent volume of distribution of atovaquone (V/F) in adult and pediatric patients after oral administration is approximately 8.8 L/kg.Proguanil is 75% protein bound. A population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the apparent V/F of proguanil in adult and pediatric patients older than 15 years with body weights from 31 to 110 kg ranged from 1,617 to 2,502 L. In pediatric patients 15 years and younger with body weights from 11 to 56 kg, the V/F of proguanil ranged from 462 to 966 L.In human plasma, the binding of atovaquone and proguanil was unaffected by the presence of the other.EliminationThe elimination half-life of atovaquone is about 2 to 3 days in adult patients. The elimination half-life of proguanil is 12 to 21 hours in both adult patients and pediatric patients, but may be longer in individuals who are slow metabolizers.The main routes of elimination are hepatic biotransformation and renal excretion.Metabolism: In a study where 14C-labeled atovaquone was administered to healthy volunteers, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days. There was little or no excretion of atovaquone in the urine (less than 0.6%). There is indirect evidence that atovaquone may undergo limited metabolism; however, a specific metabolite has not been identified. Between 40% to 60% of proguanil is excreted by the kidneys. Proguanil is metabolized to cycloguanil (primarily via cytochrome P450 2C19 [CYP2C19] and 4-chlorophenylbiguanide.Excretion: A population pharmacokinetic analysis in adult and pediatric patients showed that the apparent clearance (CL/F) of both atovaquone and proguanil is related to body weight. The values CL/F for both atovaquone and proguanil in subjects with body weight =11 kg are shown in Table 4.Table 4.

However, the elimination half-life of atovaquone is shorter in pediatric patients (1 to 2 days) than in adult patients (2 to 3 days). In clinical trials, plasma trough concentrations of atovaquone and proguanil in pediatric patients weighing 5 to 40 kg were within the range observed in adults after dosing by body weight.Geriatric Patients: In a single-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil were compared in 13 elderly subjects (aged 65 to 79 years) with those of 13 younger subjects (aged 30 to 45 years). In the elderly subjects, the extent of systemic exposure (AUC) of cycloguanil was increased (point estimate: 2.36, 90% CI: 1.70, 3.28). Tmax was longer in elderly subjects (median: 8 hours) compared with younger subjects (median 4 hours) and average elimination half-life was longer in elderly subjects (mean: 14.9 hours) compared with younger subjects (mean 8.3 hours).Patients with Renal Impairment: In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min), oral clearance and/or AUC data for atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil are within the range of values observed in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min), mean oral clearance for proguanil was reduced by approximately 35% compared with patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min) and the oral clearance of atovaquone was comparable between patients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment. No data exist on the use of MALARONE for long-term prophylaxis (over 2 months) in individuals with moderate renal failure. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), atovaquone Cmax and AUC are reduced but the elimination half-lives for proguanil and cycloguanil are prolonged, with corresponding increases in AUC, resulting in the potential of drug accumulation and toxicity with repeated dosing [see Contraindications (4.2)].Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In a single-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil were compared in 13 subjects with hepatic impairment (9 mild, 4 moderate, as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) with those of 13 subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects, there were no marked differences (<50%) in the rate or extent of systemic exposure of atovaquone. However, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the elimination half-life of atovaquone was increased (point estimate: 1.28, 90% CI: 1.00 to 1.63). Proguanil AUC, Cmax, and its elimination half-life increased in subjects with mild hepatic impairment when compared with healthy subjects (Table 5). Also, the proguanil AUC and its elimination half-life increased in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment when compared with healthy subjects. Consistent with the increase in proguanil AUC, there were marked decreases in the systemic exposure of cycloguanil (Cmax and AUC) and an increase in its elimination half-life in subjects with mild hepatic impairment when compared with healthy volunteers (Table 5). There were few measurable cycloguanil concentrations in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil after administration of MALARONE have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Table 5.

Potential pharmacokinetic interactions between proguanil or cycloguanil and other drugs that are CYP2C19 substrates or inhibitors are unknown.Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively. The mechanisms of these interactions are unknown.Tetracycline: Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with approximately a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.Metoclopramide: Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with decreased bioavailability of atovaquone.Indinavir: Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI: 8%, 35%]).","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"

"158","022268","Coartem Tablets are indicated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria infections due to Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) in patients 2 months of age and older with a bodyweight of 5 kg and above. Coartem Tablets have been shown to be effective in geographical regions where resistance to chloroquine has been reported [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].Limitations of Use:Coartem Tablets are not approved for patients with severe or complicated P. falciparum malaria.
Coartem Tablets are not approved for the prevention of malaria.","INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION"
"159","022268","Coartem Tablets should be taken with food. Patients with acute malaria are frequently averse to food. Patients should be encouraged to resume normal eating as soon as food can be tolerated since this improves absorption of artemether and lumefantrine.For patients who are unable to swallow the tablets such as infants and children, Coartem Tablets may be crushed and mixed with a small amount of water (1 to 2 teaspoons) in a clean container for administration immediately prior to use. The container can be rinsed with more water and the contents swallowed by the patient. The crushed tablet preparation should be followed whenever possible by food/drink (e.g., milk, formula, pudding, broth, and porridge).In the event of vomiting within 1 to 2 hours after administration, a repeat dose should be taken. If the repeat dose is vomited, the patient should be given an alternative antimalarial for treatment.A 3-day treatment schedule with a total of 6 doses is recommended for adult patients with a bodyweight of 35 kg and above:Four tablets as a single initial dose, 4 tablets again after 8 hours, and then 4 tablets twice-daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 24 tablets).For patients weighing less than 35 kg, [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].A 3-day treatment schedule with a total of 6 doses is recommended as below:5 kg to less than 15 kg bodyweight: One tablet as an initial dose, 1 tablet again after 8 hours, and then 1 tablet twice daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 6 tablets).15 kg to less than 25 kg bodyweight: Two tablets as an initial dose, 2 tablets again after 8 hours, and then 2 tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 12 tablets).25 kg to less than 35 kg bodyweight: Three tablets as an initial dose, 3 tablets again after 8 hours, and then 3 tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 18 tablets).35 kg bodyweight and above: Four tablets as a single initial dose, 4 tablets again after 8 hours, and then 4 tablets twice daily (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total course of 24 tablets).No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Most patients with acute malaria present with some degree of related hepatic and/or renal impairment. In clinical studies, the adverse event profile did not differ in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to patients with normal hepatic function. No specific dose adjustments are needed for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In clinical studies, the adverse event profile did not differ in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment compared to patients with normal renal function. There were few patients with severe renal impairment in clinical studies. There is no significant renal excretion of lumefantrine, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in healthy volunteers and while clinical experience in this population is limited, no dose adjustment is recommended.Caution should be exercised when administering Coartem Tablets in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].Some antimalarials (e.g., halofantrine, quinine, quinidine) including Coartem Tablets have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG).Coartem Tablets should be avoided in patients: With congenital prolongation of the QT interval (e.g., long QT syndrome) or any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval such as patients with a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, with clinically relevant bradycardia or with severe cardiac disease.
									With a family history of congenital prolongation of the QT interval or sudden death.
									With known disturbances of electrolyte balance, e.g., hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
									Receiving other medications that prolong the QT interval, such as Class IA (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents; antipsychotics (pimozide, ziprasidone); antidepressants; certain antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].
									Receiving medications that are metabolized by the cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6, which also have cardiac effects (e.g., flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Halofantrine and Coartem Tablets should not be administered within 1 month of each other due to the long elimination half-life of lumefantrine (3 to 6 days) and potential additive effects on the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Antimalarials should not be given concomitantly with Coartem Tablets, unless there is no other treatment option, due to limited safety data.Drugs that prolong the QT interval, including antimalarials such as quinine and quinidine, should be used cautiously following Coartem Tablets, due to the long elimination half-life of lumefantrine (3 to 6 days) and the potential for additive effects on the QT interval; ECG monitoring is advised if use of drugs that prolong the QT interval is medically required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.7), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If mefloquine is administered immediately prior to Coartem Tablets, there may be a decreased exposure to lumefantrine, possibly due to a mefloquine-induced decrease in bile production.Therefore, patients should be monitored for decreased efficacy and food consumption should be encouraged while taking Coartem Tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Drug Interactions (7.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].When Coartem Tablets are coadministered with substrates of CYP3A4, it may result in decreased concentrations of the substrate and potential loss of substrate efficacy. When Coartem Tablets are coadministered with an inhibitor of CYP3A4, including grapefruit juice, it may result in increased concentrations of artemether and/or lumefantrine and potentiate QT prolongation. When Coartem Tablets are coadministered with inducers of CYP3A4, it may result in decreased concentrations of artemether and/or lumefantrine and loss of antimalarial efficacy [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)].Drugs that have a mixed effect on CYP3A4, especially antiretroviral drugs such as HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and those that have an effect on the QT interval should be used with caution in patients taking Coartem Tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.3, 7.7)].Coartem Tablets may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, patients using hormonal contraceptives should be advised to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception during treatment with Coartem [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].Administration of Coartem Tablets with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 may significantly increase plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug and increase the risk of adverse effects. Many of the drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can prolong the QT interval and should not be administered with Coartem Tablets due to the potential additive effect on the QT interval (e.g., flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Food enhances absorption of artemether and lumefantrine following administration of Coartem Tablets. Patients who remain averse to food during treatment should be closely monitored as the risk of recrudescence may be greater [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].In the event of recrudescent P. falciparum infection after treatment with Coartem Tablets, patients should be treated with a different antimalarial drug.
								Coartem Tablets have not been studied for efficacy and safety in patients with severe hepatic and/or renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].Coartem Tablets have been shown in limited data (43 patients) to be effective in treating the erythrocytic stage of P. vivax infection. However, relapsing malaria caused by P. vivax requires additional treatment with other antimalarial agents to achieve radical cure i.e., eradicate any hypnozoites forms that may remain dormant in the liver.Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rate observed in practice.The data described below reflect exposure to a 6-dose regimen of Coartem Tablets in 1979 patients including 647 adults (older than 16 years) and 1332 children (16 years and younger). For the 6-dose regimen, Coartem Tablets was studied in active-controlled (366 patients) and noncontrolled, open-label trials (1613 patients). The 6-dose Coartem Tablets population was patients with malaria between ages 2 months and 71 years: 67% (1332) were 16 years and younger and 33% (647) were older than 16 years. Males represented 73% and 53% of the adult and pediatric populations, respectively. The majority of adult patients were enrolled in studies in Thailand, while the majority of pediatric patients were enrolled in Africa.Tables 1 and 2 show the most frequently reported adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 3%) in adults and children respectively who received the 6-dose regimen of Coartem Tablets. Adverse reactions collected in clinical trials included signs and symptoms at baseline, but only treatment emergent adverse events, defined as events that appeared or worsened after the start of treatment, are presented below. In adults, the most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, anorexia, dizziness, and asthenia. In children, the adverse reactions were pyrexia, cough, vomiting, anorexia, and headache. Most adverse reactions were mild, did not lead to discontinuation of study medication, and resolved.In limited comparative studies, the adverse reaction profile of Coartem Tablets appeared similar to that of another antimalarial regimen.Discontinuation of Coartem Tablets due to adverse drug reactions occurred in 1.1% of patients treated with the 6-dose regimen overall: 0.2% (1/647) in adults and 1.6% (21/1332) in children.

Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Hypersensitivity Reactions: anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, and serious skin reactions (bullous eruption) have been reported.Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Cases of delayed hemolytic anemia have been reported following treatment with artemether-lumefantrine, mostly when used for treatment of severe malaria in patients initially treated with IV/parenteral artesunate. Coartem Tablets should not be used to treat severe malaria as it is not an approved indication.Oral administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, with Coartem Tablets resulted in significant decreases in exposure to artemether, DHA (metabolite of artemether), and lumefantrine by 89%, 85%, and 68%, respectively, when compared to exposure values after Coartem Tablets alone. Concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort is contraindicated with Coartem Tablets [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Concurrent oral administration of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, with a single dose of Coartem Tablets resulted in a moderate increase in exposure to artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine in a study of 15 healthy subjects. No dose adjustment of Coartem Tablets is necessary when administered with ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, due to the potential for increased concentrations of lumefantrine which could lead to QT prolongation, Coartem Tablets should be used cautiously with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Both artemether and lumefantrine are metabolized by CYP3A4. Antiretroviral drugs, such as protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are known to have variable patterns of inhibition, induction or competition for CYP3A4. Therefore, the effects of antiretroviral drugs on the exposure to artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine are also variable [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coartem Tablets should be used cautiously in patients on antiretroviral drugs because decreased artemether, DHA, and/or lumefantrine concentrations may result in a decrease of antimalarial efficacy of Coartem Tablets, and increased lumefantrine concentrations may cause QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Administration of 3 doses of mefloquine followed 12 hours later by a 6-dose regimen of Coartem Tablets in 14 healthy volunteers demonstrated no effect of mefloquine on plasma concentrations of artemether or the artemether/DHA ratio. However, exposure to lumefantrine was reduced, possibly due to lower absorption secondary to a mefloquine-induced decrease in bile production. Patients should be monitored for decreased efficacy and food consumption should be encouraged with administration of Coartem Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].In vitro, the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel was not induced by artemether, DHA, or lumefantrine. However, artemether has been reported to weakly induce, in humans, the activity of CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4. Therefore, Coartem Tablets may potentially reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Patients using hormonal contraception should be advised to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception during treatment with Coartem [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Lumefantrine inhibits CYP2D6 in vitro. Administration of Coartem Tablets with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 may significantly increase plasma concentrations of the coadministered drug and increase the risk of adverse effects. Many of the drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can prolong the QT interval and should not be administered with Coartem Tablets due to the potential additive effect on the QT interval (e.g., flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].A single dose of intravenous quinine (10 mg/kg bodyweight) concurrent with the final dose of a 6-dose regimen of Coartem Tablets demonstrated no effect of intravenous quinine on the systemic exposure of DHA or lumefantrine. Quinine exposure was also not altered. Exposure to artemether was decreased. This decrease in artemether exposure is not thought to be clinically significant. However, quinine and other drugs that prolong the QT interval should be used cautiously following treatment with Coartem Tablets due to the long elimination half-life of lumefantrine and the potential for additive QT effects; ECG monitoring is advised if use of drugs that prolong the QT interval is medically required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Coartem Tablets are to be used with caution when coadministered with drugs that may cause prolonged QT interval such as antiarrhythmics of Classes IA and III, neuroleptics and antidepressant agents, certain antibiotics including some agents of the following classes: macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].No specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with either hepatic or renal impairment. Coartem Tablets have not been studied for efficacy and safety in patients with severe hepatic and/or renal impairment. Based on the pharmacokinetic data in 16 healthy subjects showing no or insignificant renal excretion of lumefantrine, artemether, and DHA, no dose adjustment for the use of Coartem Tablets in patients with renal impairment is advised. No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].In a healthy adult volunteer parallel-group study including a placebo and moxifloxacin control-group (n = 42 per group), the administration of the 6-dose regimen of Coartem Tablets was associated with prolongation of QTcF (Fridericia). Following administration of a 6-dose regimen of Coartem Tablets consisting of 4 tablets per dose (total of 4 tablets of 80 mg artemether/480 mg lumefantrine) taken with food, the maximum mean change from baseline and placebo adjusted QTcF was 7.5 msec (1-sided 95% upper confidence interval: 11 msec). There was a concentration-dependent increase in QTcF for lumefantrine.In clinical trials conducted in children, no patient had QTcF greater than 500 msec. Over 5% of patients had an increase in QTcF of over 60 msec.In clinical trials conducted in adults, QTcF prolongation of greater than 500 msec was reported in 3 (0.3%) patients. Over 6% of adults had a QTcF increase of over 60 msec from baseline.The efficacy of Coartem Tablets was evaluated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum in HIV negative patients in 8 clinical studies. Uncomplicated malaria was defined as symptomatic P. falciparum malaria without signs and symptoms of severe malaria or evidence of vital organ dysfunction. Baseline parasite density ranged from 500/mcL to 200,000/mcL (0.01% to 4% parasitemia) in the majority of patients. Studies were conducted in partially immune and non-immune adults and children (greater than or equal to 5 kg body weight) with uncomplicated malaria in China, Thailand, sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and South America. Patients who had clinical features of severe malaria, severe cardiac, renal, or hepatic impairment were excluded.The studies include two 4-dose studies assessing the efficacy of the components of the regimen, a study comparing a 4-dose versus a 6-dose regimen, and 5 additional 6-dose regimen studies.Coartem Tablets were administered at 0, 8, 24, and 48 hours in the 4-dose regimen, and at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours in the 6-dose regimen. Efficacy endpoints consisted of:28-day cure rate, defined as clearance of asexual parasites (the erythrocytic stage) within 7 days without recrudescence by Day 28
									parasite clearance time (PCT), defined as time from first dose until first total and continued disappearance of asexual parasite which continues for a further 48 hours
									fever clearance time (FCT), defined as time from first dose until the first time body temperature fell below 37.5°C and remained below 37.5°C for at least a further 48 hours (only for patients with temperature greater than 37.5°C at baseline)The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population includes all patients with malaria diagnosis confirmation who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Evaluable patients generally are all patients who had a Day 7 and a Day 28 parasitological assessment or experienced treatment failure by Day 28.Studies 1 and 2: The 2 studies, which assessed the efficacy of Coartem Tablets (4 doses of 4 tablets of 20 mg artemether/120 mg lumefantrine) compared to each component alone, were randomized, double-blind, comparative, single center, conducted in China. The efficacy results (Table 5) support that the combination of artemether and lumefantrine in Coartem Tablets had a significantly higher 28-day cure rate compared to artemether and had a significantly faster PCT and FCT compared to lumefantrine.Table 5: Clinical Efficacy of Coartem Tablets Versus Components (mITT Population)1

Therefore, Study 3 was conducted.Study 3: Study 3 was a randomized, double-blind, 2-center study conducted in Thailand in adults and children (aged greater than or equal to 2 years), which compared the 4-dose regimen (administered over 48 hours) of Coartem Tablets to a 6-dose regimen (administered over 60 hours). Twenty-eight day cure rate in mITT subjects was 81% (96/118) for the Coartem Tablets 6-dose arm as compared to 71% (85/120) in the 4-dose arm. Studies 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8: In these studies, Coartem Tablets were administered as the 6-dose regimen. In study 4, a total of 150 adults and children aged greater than or equal to 2 years received Coartem Tablets. In study 5, a total 164 adults and children greater than or equal to 12 years received Coartem Tablets. Both studies were conducted in Thailand.Study 6 was a study of 165 non-immune adults residing in regions non-endemic for malaria (Europe and Colombia) who contracted acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria when traveling in endemic regions.Study 7 was conducted in Africa in 310 infants and children aged 2 months to 9 years, weighing 5 kg to 25 kg, with an axillary temperature greater than or equal to 37.5ºC.Study 8 was conducted in Africa in 452 infants and children, aged 3 months to 12 years, weighing 5 kg to less than 35 kg, with fever (greater than or equal to 37.5°C axillary or greater than or equal to 38°C rectally) or history of fever in the preceding 24 hours.Results of 28-day cure rate, median PCT, and FCT for Studies 3 to 8 are reported in Table 6.Table 6: Clinical Efficacy of 6-dose Regimen of Coartem TabletsStudy No. Region/ages28-day cure rate1 n/N (%) PatientsMedian FCT2[25th, 75th percentile]Median PCT[25th, 75th percentile]mITT3EvaluableStudy 3 Thailand, ages 3–62 years96/118 (81.4)93/96 (96.9)35 hours[20, 46]44 hours[22, 47]Early failure4

3Coartem Tablets administered as crushed tablets.The efficacy of Coartem Tablets for the treatment P. falciparum infections mixed with P. vivax was assessed in a small number of patients. Coartem Tablets are only active against the erythrocytic phase of P. vivax malaria. Of the 43 patients with mixed infections at baseline, all cleared their parasitemia within 48 hours. However, parasite relapse occurred commonly (14/43; 33%). Relapsing malaria caused by P. vivax requires additional treatment with other antimalarial agents to achieve radical cure i.e., eradicate any hypnozoite forms that may remain dormant in the liver.","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"

"183","022268","Risk SummaryPublished data from clinical studies and pharmacovigilance data have not established an association with artemether/lumefantrine use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal RiskMalaria during and after pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes, including maternal anemia, severe malaria, spontaneous abortion, stillbirths, preterm delivery, low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, congenital malaria, and maternal and neonatal mortality.DataHuman DataWhile available studies cannot definitively establish the absence of risk, a meta-analysis of observational studies including over 500 artemether-lumefantrine exposed women in their first trimester of pregnancy, data from observational, and open label studies including more than 1200 pregnant women in their second- or third trimester exposed to artemether-lumefantrine compared to other antimalarials, and pharmacovigilance data have not demonstrated an increase in major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Published epidemiologic studies have important methodological limitations which hinder interpretation of data, including inability to control for confounders, such as underlying maternal disease, and maternal use of concomitant medications and missing information on the dose and duration of use.Animal DataPregnant rats dosed orally during the period of organogenesis [gestational days (GD) 7 through 17] at 50 mg/kg/day artemether-lumefantrine combination (corresponding to 7 mg/kg/day artemether or higher, a dose of less than half the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 1120 mg artemether-lumefantrine per day (based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons), showed increases in fetal loss, early resorptions, and postimplantation loss. No adverse effects were observed in animals dosed at 25 mg/kg/day artemether-lumefantrine (corresponding to 3.6 mg/kg/day of artemether), about one-third the MRHD (based on BSA comparison). Similarly, oral dosing in pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (GD 7 through GD 19) at 175 mg/kg/day, (corresponding to 25 mg/kg/day artemether) about 3 times the MRHD (based on BSA comparisons) resulted in abortions, preimplantation loss, post implantation loss and decreases in the number of live fetuses. No adverse reproductive effects were detected in rabbits at 105 mg/kg/day artemether-lumefantrine (corresponding to 15 mg/kg/day artemether), about 2 times the MRHD. Artemether and other artemisinins are associated with maternal toxicity and embryotoxicity and malformations in animals at clinically relevant exposures; however, lumefantrine doses as high as 1000 mg/kg/day, showed no evidence to suggest maternal, embryo- or fetotoxicity or teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. The relevance of the findings from the animal reproductive studies to human risk is unclear.","PREGNANCY SECTION"
"184","022268","Risk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of artemether or lumefantrine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Artemether and lumefantrine are transferred into rat milk. When a drug is transferred into animal milk, it is likely that the drug will also be transferred into human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for Coartem and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Coartem or from the underlying maternal condition.","LACTATION SECTION"

Advise patients using hormonal contraceptives to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception during treatment with Coartem [see Drug Interactions (7.5)].InfertilityIn animal fertility studies, administration of repeated doses of artemether-lumefantrine combination to female rats (for 2 to 4 weeks) resulted in pregnancy rates that were reduced by one half. In male rats dosed for approximately 3 months with artemether-lumefantrine combination, abnormal sperm cells, decreased sperm motility, and increased testes weight were observed [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].","FEMALES & MALES OF REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL SECTION"

"192","022268","AbsorptionFollowing administration of Coartem Tablets to healthy volunteers and patients with malaria, artemether is absorbed with peak plasma concentrations reached about 2 hours after dosing. Absorption of lumefantrine, a highly lipophilic compound, starts after a lag-time of up to 2 hours, with peak plasma concentrations about 6 to 8 hours after administration. The single dose (4 tablets) pharmacokinetic parameters for artemether, DHA, an active antimalarial metabolite of artemether, and lumefantrine in adult Caucasian healthy volunteers are given in Table 3. Multiple dose data after the 6-dose regimen of Coartem Tablets in adult malaria patients are given in Table 4.Table 3: Single Dose Pharmacokinetic Parametersa for Artemether, Dihydroartemisinin, and Lumefantrine Under-Fed ConditionsAbbreviations: DHA, dihydroartemisinin; SD, standard deviation; AUC, area under the curve.

In healthy volunteers, the relative bioavailability of artemether was increased between 2- to 3-fold, and that of lumefantrine 16-fold when Coartem Tablets were taken after a high-fat meal compared under fasted conditions. Patients should be encouraged to take Coartem Tablets with a meal as soon as food can be tolerated [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].DistributionArtemether and lumefantrine are both highly bound to human serum proteins in vitro (95.4% and 99.7%, respectively). Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is also bound to human serum proteins (47% to 76%). Protein binding to human plasma proteins is linear.Biotransformation In human liver microsomes and recombinant CYP450 enzymes, the metabolism of artemether was catalyzed predominantly by CYP3A4/5. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is an active metabolite of artemether. The metabolism of artemether was also catalyzed to a lesser extent by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. In vitro studies with artemether at therapeutic concentrations revealed no significant inhibition of the metabolic activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, and CYP4A9/11. In vitro studies with artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine at therapeutic concentrations revealed no significant induction of the metabolic activities of CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, or CYP3A5.During repeated administration of Coartem Tablets, systemic exposure of artemether decreased significantly, while concentrations of DHA increased, although not to a statistically significant degree. The artemether/DHA area under the curve (AUC) ratio is 1.2 after a single dose and 0.3 after 6 doses given over 3 days. This suggests that there was induction of enzymes responsible for the metabolism of artemether.In human liver microsomes and in recombinant CYP450 enzymes, lumefantrine was metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 to desbutyl-lumefantrine. The systemic exposure to the metabolite desbutyl-lumefantrine was less than 1% of the exposure to the parent compound. In vitro, lumefantrine significantly inhibits the activity of CYP2D6 at therapeutic plasma concentrations.Caution is recommended when combining Coartem Tablets with substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4, especially antiretroviral drugs and those that prolong the QT interval (e.g., macrolide antibiotics, pimozide) [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3), and Drug Interactions (7)].Coadministration of Coartem Tablets with CYP2D6 substrates may result in increased plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 substrate and increase the risk of adverse reactions. In addition, many of the drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 can prolong the QT interval and should not be administered with Coartem Tablets due to the potential additive effect on the QT interval (e.g., flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.4) and Drug Interactions (7.6)].EliminationArtemether and DHA are cleared from plasma with an elimination half-life of about 2 hours. Lumefantrine is eliminated more slowly, with an elimination half-life of 3 to 6 days in healthy volunteers and in patients with falciparum malaria. Demographic characteristics such as sex and weight appear to have no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of artemether and lumefantrine.In 16 healthy volunteers, neither lumefantrine nor artemether was found in the urine after administration of Coartem Tablets, and urinary excretion of DHA amounted to less than 0.01% of the artemether dose.Specific PopulationsHepatic and Renal ImpairmentNo specific pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with either hepatic or renal impairment. There is no significant renal excretion of lumefantrine, artemether, and DHA in healthy volunteers and while clinical experience in this population is limited, no dose adjustment in renal impairment is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].Pediatric PatientsThe PK of artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine were obtained in 2 pediatric studies by sparse sampling using a population-based approach. PK estimates derived from a composite plasma concentration profile for artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine are provided in Table 4. Systemic exposure to artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine, when dosed on an mg/kg body weight basis in pediatric patients (greater than or equal to 5 to less than 35 kg body weight), is comparable to that of the recommended dosing regimen in adult patients.Table 4: Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Lumefantrine, Artemether, and DHA in Pediatric and Adult Patients With Malaria Following Administration of a 6-dose Regimen of Coartem TabletsAdults1

Concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort is contraindicated with Coartem Tablets [see Contraindications (4)]. Ketoconazole (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor)Concurrent oral administration of ketoconazole (400 mg on day 1 followed by 200 mg on Days 2, 3, 4, and 5) with Coartem Tablets (single-dose of 4 tablets of 20 mg artemether/120 mg lumefantrine per tablet) with a meal led to an increase in exposure, in terms of AUC, of artemether (2.3-fold), DHA (1.5-fold), and lumefantrine (1.6-fold) in 13 healthy subjects. The pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not evaluated. Based on this study, dose adjustment of Coartem Tablets is considered unnecessary when administered with ketoconazole or other CYP3A4 inhibitors. However, due to the potential for increased concentrations of lumefantrine, which could lead to QT prolongation, Coartem Tablets should be used cautiously with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 (e.g., antiretroviral drugs, macrolide antibiotics, antidepressants, imidazole antifungal agents) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.3)].AntimalarialsThe oral administration of mefloquine in 14 healthy volunteers administered as 3 doses of500 mg, 250 mg, and 250 mg, followed 12 hours later by Coartem Tablets (6 doses of 4 tablets of 20 mg artemether/120 mg lumefantrine per tablet), had no effect on plasma concentrations of artemether or the artemether/DHA ratio. In the same study, there was a 30% reduction in Cmax and 40% reduction in AUC of lumefantrine, possibly due to lower absorption secondary to a mefloquine-induced decrease in bile production.Intravenous administration of a single dose of quinine (10 mg/kg bodyweight) concurrent with the last dose of a 6-dose regimen of Coartem Tablets had no effect on systemic exposure of DHA, lumefantrine, or quinine in 14 healthy volunteers. Mean AUC of artemether were 46% lower when administered with quinine compared to Coartem Tablets alone. This decrease in artemether exposure is not thought to be clinically significant. However, quinine should be used cautiously in patients following treatment with Coartem Tablets due to the long elimination half-life of lumefantrine and the potential for additive effects on the QT interval; ECG monitoring is advised if use of quinine is medically required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].Antiretroviral DrugsThe oral administration of lopinavir/ritonavir (400 mg/100 mg twice daily for 26 days) in 10 healthy volunteers coadministered with Coartem Tablets (6-dose regimen over 3 days), resulted in a decrease in systemic exposures, in terms of AUC, to artemether and DHA by approximately 40%, but an increase in exposure to lumefantrine by approximately 2.3-fold. The oral administration of efavirenz (600 mg once daily for 26 days) in 12 healthy volunteers coadministered with Coartem Tablets (6-dose regimen over 3 days), resulted in a decrease in exposures to artemether, DHA, and lumefantrine by approximately 50%, 45%, and 20%, respectively. Exposures to lopinavir/ritonavir and efavirenz were not significantly affected by concomitant use of Coartem Tablets. Coartem Tablets should be used cautiously in patients on antiretroviral drugs such as HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors because decreased artemether, DHA, and/or lumefantrine concentrations may result in a decrease of antimalarial efficacy of Coartem Tablets, and increased lumefantrine concentrations may cause QT prolongation[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.3)].Hormonal ContraceptivesNo clinical drug-drug interaction studies between Coartem Tablets and hormonal contraceptives have been performed. In vitro studies revealed that the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel was not induced by artemether, DHA, or lumefantrine. However, artemether has been reported to weakly induce, in humans, the activity of CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4. Therefore, coadministration of Coartem Tablets may potentially reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7.5)]. ","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"
"193","022268","Mechanism of ActionCoartem Tablets, a fixed ratio of 1:6 parts of artemether and lumefantrine, respectively, is an antimalarial agent. Artemether is rapidly metabolized into an active metabolite DHA. The antimalarial activity of artemether and DHA has been attributed to endoperoxide moiety. The exact mechanism by which lumefantrine exerts its antimalarial effect is not well defined. Available data suggest lumefantrine inhibits the formation of ß-hematin by forming a complex with hemin. Both artemether and lumefantrine were shown to inhibit nucleic acid and protein synthesis. Activity In Vitro and In Vivo
Artemether and lumefantrine are active against the erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. Drug ResistanceThere is a potential for development of resistance to artemether and lumefantrine. Strains of P. falciparum with a moderate decrease in susceptibility to artemether or lumefantrine alone can be selected in vitro or in vivo, but not maintained in the case of artemether. Alterations in some genetic regions of P. falciparum [multidrug resistant 1 (pfmdr1), chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt), and kelch 13 (K13)] based on in vitro testing and/or identification of isolates in endemic areas where artemether/lumefantrine treatment was administered, have been reported. The clinical relevance of these findings are not known.","MICROBIOLOGY SECTION"
"195","022268","CarcinogenesisCarcinogenicity studies were not conducted.MutagenesisNo evidence of mutagenicity was detected. The artemether-lumefantrine combination was evaluated using the Salmonella and Escherichia/mammalian-microsome mutagenicity test, the gene mutation test with Chinese hamster cells V79, the cytogenetic test on Chinese hamster cells in vitro, and the rat micronucleus test, in vivo.Impairment of FertilityPregnancy rates were reduced by about one-half in female rats dosed for 2 to 4 weeks with the artemether-lumefantrine combination at 1000 mg/kg (about 9 times the clinical dose based on BSA comparisons). Male rats dosed for 89 to 93 days showed increases in abnormal sperm (87% abnormal) at 30 mg/kg doses (about one-third the clinical dose). Higher doses (about 9 times the MRHD) resulted in increased testes weights, decreased sperm motility, and 100% abnormal sperm cells.","CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY SECTION"

"199","022268","Advise patients to read the FDA-Approved Patient Labeling (Patient Information).Administration InstructionsInstruct patients to take Coartem Tablets with food. Patients who do not have an adequate intake of food are at risk for recrudescence of malaria [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
						HypersensitivityPatients with known hypersensitivity to artemether, lumefantrine, or to any of the excipients should not receive Coartem Tablets [see Contraindications (4)].
						Prolongation of the QT IntervalInstruct patients to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
							Instruct patients to inform their physician if they are taking any other medications that prolong the QT interval, such as Class IA (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents; antipsychotics (pimozide, ziprasidone); antidepressants; certain antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
							Instruct patients to notify their physicians if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 
							Drug Interactions With CYP2D6Instruct patients to avoid medications that are metabolized by the cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6 while receiving Coartem Tablets since these drugs also have cardiac effects (e.g., flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].ContraceptionAdvise patients that use of Coartem may reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives. Advise patients using hormonal contraceptive to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception during treatment with Coartem [see Drug Interactions (7.5) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].Use of QT Prolonging Drugs and Other AntimalarialsHalofantrine and Coartem Tablets should not be administered within 1 month of each other due to potential additive effects on the QT interval. Antimalarials should not be given concomitantly with Coartem Tablets, unless there is no other treatment option, due to limited safety data [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].Sequential Use of QuinineQT prolonging drugs, including quinine and quinidine, should be used cautiously following Coartem Tablets due to the long elimination half-life of lumefantrine and the potential for additive effects on the QT interval. ECG monitoring is advised if use of drugs that prolong the QT interval is medically required [see Drug Interactions (7.7)].Prior Use of MefloquineClosely monitor food intake in patients who received mefloquine immediately prior to treatment with Coartem Tablets [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].Drug Interactions With CYP3A4Use Coartem Tablets cautiously in patients receiving other drugs that are substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, including grapefruit juice, especially those that prolong the QT interval or are antiretroviral drugs. Coadministration of strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort is contraindicated with Coartem Tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].Hypersensitivity ReactionsInform patients that Coartem Tablets can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Instruct patients to discontinue the drug at the first sign of a skin rash, hives or other skin reactions, a rapid heartbeat, difficulty in swallowing or breathing, any swelling suggesting angioedema (e.g., swelling of the lips, tongue, face, tightness of the throat, hoarseness), or other symptoms of an allergic reaction [see Contraindications (4)].T2019-88","INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS SECTION"

"203","040081","Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the:Treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium ovale.
Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported.Limitations of Use:Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for:Treatment of complicated malaria.Treatment of malaria by chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species [see Microbiology (12.4)].
Treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified.Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs.Prevention of relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite liver stage forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].
For the most current information about drug resistance, refer to the latest recommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 1.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus in adults.
Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.ProphylaxisTreatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:Adult patients: 400 mg once a weekPediatric patients = 31kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a weekTreatment of Uncomplicated MalariaThe dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:
Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg).Pediatric patients = 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg).For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].
The recommended dosage is:Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.
The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.
Fatal and life-threatening cases of cardiotoxicity, including cardiomyopathy, have been reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. Signs and symptoms of cardiac compromise have occurred during acute and chronic hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets treatment. Patients may present with ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension and conduction disorders including sick sinus syndrome. ECG findings include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate has a potential to prolong the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes) have been reported in hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets-treated patients. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug. Therefore, the recommended dose should not be exceeded [see Adverse Reactions (6), Overdosage (10)]. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets administration in patients with congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation and/or known risk factors for prolongation of the QT interval such as:
Cardiac disease, e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction.Proarrhythmic conditions, e.g., bradycardia (< 50 bpm).History of ventricular dysrhythmias.Uncorrected hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia.Concomitant administration with QT interval prolonging agents [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] as this may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias.Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval. Monitor cardiac function as clinically indicated during hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets therapy. Correct electrolyte imbalances prior to use. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets if cardiotoxicity is suspected.Irreversible retinal damage was observed in some patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate and it is related to cumulative dosage and treatment duration. In patients of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula.Risk factors for retinal damage include daily hydroxychloroquine sulfate dosages =5 mg/kg of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, renal impairment, use of concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate, and concurrent macular disease.
Within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, a baseline ocular examination is recommended including best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For patients at higher risk of retinal damage, monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For patients without significant risk factors, annual retinal exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.
If ocular toxicity is suspected, discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and monitor the patient closely given that retinal changes and visual disturbances may progress even after cessation of therapy.
Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Monitor for serious skin reactions, especially in patients receiving a drug that may also induce dermatitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention promptly if they experience signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions such as blisters on the skin, eyes, lips or in the mouth, itching or burning, with or without fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6)]. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets if these severe reactions occur.
Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe flare-up of psoriasis. Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with porphyria may exacerbate porphyria. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with psoriasis or porphyria, unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible risk.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may cause myelosuppression including aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Monitor blood cell counts periodically in patients on prolonged hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets therapy. If the patient develops myelosuppression which cannot be attributable to the disease, discontinue the drug.
Hemolysis has been reported in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Monitor for hemolytic anemia as this can occur, particularly in association with other drugs that cause hemolysis.
Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have demonstrated bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. If weakness occurs, discontinue the drug.
Suicidal behavior has been reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Alert patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or mood changes. The risk and benefit of continued treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should be assessed for patients who develop these symptoms.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can cause severe and potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia, in the presence or absence of antidiabetic agents [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Measure blood glucose in patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia and as adjust the antidiabetic treatment as necessary. Warn hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets -treated patients about the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; diabetic patients should monitor their blood sugar levels. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they develop any signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolongs the QT interval. There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval or are arrhythmogenic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1].

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may enhance the effects of insulin and antidiabetic drugs, and consequently increase the hypoglycemic risk. Therefore, a decrease in dosage of insulin and other antidiabetic drugs may be necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8
)].
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can lower the seizure threshold. Coadministration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets with other antimalarials known to lower the seizure threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of seizures.
The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if coadministered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.
Concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and methotrexate may increase the incidence of adverse reactions.
An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets were coadministered. Monitor serum cyclosporine levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.
Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels. Monitor serum digoxin levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.
Concomitant use of cimetidine resulted in a 2-fold increase of exposure of chloroquine, which is structurally related to hydroxychloroquine. Interaction of cimetidine with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out. Avoid concomitant use of cimetidine.
Lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine was reported when rifampicin was concomitantly administered. Avoid concomitant use of rifampicin.
Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Interaction of praziquantel with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.
Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Interaction of antacids and kaolin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.
In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. Interaction of ampicillin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.
A reduction in the dosage of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease.
Mechanism of Action in MalariaThe precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.Antimicrobial ActivityHydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite liver stage forms of P. vivax and P. ovale.Drug ResistanceP. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine. Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread [see Indications and Usage (1.1)].Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Tablets USP, 200 mg (equivalent to 155 mg of base), are white, unscored, film-coated, capsule-shaped tablets debossed “TV” and “2401” on one side and plain on the other side in bottles of 100 (NDC 0093-2401-01).

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated or increased disease activity from malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with hydroxychloroquine.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal RiskMalaria: Malaria during pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal anemia, prematurity, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth.Rheumatoid Arthritis: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus, especially those with increased disease activity, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, fetal death, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Passage of maternal auto-antibodies across the placenta may result in neonatal illness, including neonatal lupus and congenital heart block.DataHuman Data Data from published epidemiologic and clinical studies have not established an association with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Hydroxychloroquine readily crosses the placenta with cord blood levels corresponding to maternal plasma levels. No retinal toxicity, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, or growth and developmental abnormalities have been observed in children who were exposed to hydroxychloroquine in utero. Available epidemiologic and clinical studies have methodological limitations including small sample size and study design.","PREGNANCY SECTION"

Following a single oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablet dose of 200 mg, the mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74 (compared to administration of 155 mg of hydroxychloroquine intravenous infusion). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine.After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.
In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity.
DistributionHydroxychloroquine sulfate is extensively distributed to tissues.EliminationA half-life of 123.5 days in plasma were observed following a single 200 mg oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablet dose to healthy male volunteers. Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, the absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days.MetabolismSignificant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) were found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite.Excretion Renal clearance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for at least 6 months was similar to that in single dose studies in healthy volunteers, suggesting that no change in clearance occurred with chronic dosing.

"257","040104","Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the:•Treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium ovale.
•Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported.Limitations of UseHydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended for:•Treatment of complicated malaria.•Treatment of malaria by chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species [see Microbiology (12.4)].•Treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified.•Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs.•Prevention of relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite liver stage forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].
For the most current information about drug resistance, refer to the latest recommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.1
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus in adults.Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.Prophylaxis Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:•Adult patients: 400 mg once a week•Pediatric patients = 31kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a weekTreatment of Uncomplicated Malaria The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are: •Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg). •Pediatric patients = 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg). For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (
12.4)].
The recommended dosage is: •Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. •Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses. Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.Fatal and life-threatening cases of cardiotoxicity, including cardiomyopathy, have been reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Signs and symptoms of cardiac compromise have occurred during acute and chronic hydroxychloroquine sulfate treatment. Patients may present with ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension and conduction disorders including sick sinus syndrome. ECG findings include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate has a potential to prolong the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes) have been reported in hydroxychloroquine sulfate -treated patients. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug. Therefore, the recommended dose should not be exceeded [see Adverse Reactions (6), Overdosage (10)]. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate administration in patients with congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation and/or known risk factors for prolongation of the QT interval such as:•Cardiac disease, e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction.•Proarrhythmic conditions, e.g., bradycardia (< 50 bpm).•History of ventricular dysrhythmias.•Uncorrected hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia.•Concomitant administration with QT interval prolonging agents [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] as this may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias.Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval. Monitor cardiac function as clinically indicated during hydroxychloroquine sulfate therapy. Correct electrolyte imbalances prior to use. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate if cardiotoxicity is suspected.Irreversible retinal damage was observed in some patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate and it is related to cumulative dosage and treatment duration. In patients of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula.Risk factors for retinal damage include daily hydroxychloroquine sulfate dosages =5 mg/kg of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, renal impairment, use of concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate, and concurrent macular disease.Within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate, a baseline ocular examination is recommended including best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For patients at higher risk of retinal damage, monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For patients without significant risk factors, annual retinal exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.If ocular toxicity is suspected, discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate and monitor the patient closely given that retinal changes and visual disturbances may progress even after cessation of therapy.Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate including Stevens- Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Monitor for serious skin reactions, especially in patients receiving a drug that may also induce dermatitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention promptly if they experience signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions such as blisters on the skin, eyes, lips or in the mouth, itching or burning, with or without fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6)]. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate if these severe reactions occur.Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe flare-up of psoriasis. Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with porphyria may exacerbate porphyria. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis or porphyria, unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible risk.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate may cause myelosuppression including aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Monitor blood cell counts periodically in patients on prolonged hydroxychloroquine sulfate therapy. If the patient develops myelosuppression which cannot be attributable to the disease, discontinue the drug.Hemolysis has been reported in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Monitor for hemolytic anemia as this can occur, particularly in association with other drugs that cause hemolysis.Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have demonstrated bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate. If weakness occurs, discontinue the drug.Suicidal behavior has been reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Alert patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or mood changes. The risk and benefit of continued treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be assessed for patients who develop these symptoms.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate can cause severe and potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia, in the presence or absence of antidiabetic agents [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Measure blood glucose in patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia and as adjust the antidiabetic treatment as necessary. Warn hydroxychloroquine sulfate -treated patients about the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; diabetic patients should monitor their blood sugar levels. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they develop any signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate prolongs the QT interval. There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval or are arrhythmogenic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate may enhance the effects of insulin and antidiabetic drugs, and consequently increase the hypoglycemic risk. Therefore, a decrease in dosage of insulin and other antidiabetic drugs may be necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate can lower the seizure threshold. Co-administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate with other antimalarials known to lower the seizure threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of seizures.The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co-administered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.Concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and methotrexate may increase the incidence of adverse reactions.An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate were co-administered. Monitor serum cyclosporine levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels. Monitor serum digoxin levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.Concomitant use of cimetidine resulted in a 2-fold increase of exposure of chloroquine, which is structurally related to hydroxychloroquine. Interaction of cimetidine with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out. Avoid concomitant use of cimetidine.Lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine was reported when rifampicin was concomitantly administered. Avoid concomitant use of rifampicin.Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Interaction of praziquantel with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Interaction of antacids and kaolin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. Interaction of ampicillin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.A reduction in the dosage of hydroxychloroquine sulfate may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease.Mechanism of Action in Malaria The precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA. Antimicrobial Activity Hydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite liver stage forms of P. vivax and P. ovale. Drug Resistance P. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine. Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread [see Indications and Usage (1.1)].Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, USP for oral administration are available as:200 mg: Round, Off White, Standard Cup Tablet Core, Debossed GG 260 on One Side and Plain on the Reverse Side, Film Coated WhiteNDC 0781-5994-01 bottles of 100NDC 0781-5994-05 bottles of 500Each tablet contains 200 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate, USP (equivalent to 155 mg base).Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].Do not crush or divide hydroxychloroquine sulfate film-coated tablets, USP (see Dosage and Administration).Dispense in a tight, light-resistant container.KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN.Manufactured bySandoz Inc.Princeton, NJ 08540 Rev.

Following a single oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate dose of 200 mg, the mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74 (compared to administration of 155 mg of hydroxychloroquine intravenous infusion). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity. Distribution Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is extensively distributed to tissues. Elimination A half-life of 123.5 days in plasma were observed following a single 200 mg oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate dose to healthy male volunteers. Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug.

"309","040133","Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the:Treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium ovale.
Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported.Limitations of Use:Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for:Treatment of complicated malaria.Treatment of malaria by chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species [see Microbiology (12.4)].
Treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified.Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs.Prevention of relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite liver stage forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].
For the most current information about drug resistance, refer to the latest recommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 1.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus in adults.
Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided.ProphylaxisTreatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:Adult patients: 400 mg once a weekPediatric patients = 31kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a weekTreatment of Uncomplicated MalariaThe dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are:
Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg).Pediatric patients = 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg - up to 2000 mg).For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].
The recommended dosage is:Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses.Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.
The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses.
Fatal and life-threatening cases of cardiotoxicity, including cardiomyopathy, have been reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. Signs and symptoms of cardiac compromise have occurred during acute and chronic hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets treatment. Patients may present with ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension and conduction disorders including sick sinus syndrome. ECG findings include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate has a potential to prolong the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes) have been reported in hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets-treated patients. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug. Therefore, the recommended dose should not be exceeded [see Adverse Reactions (6), Overdosage (10)]. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets administration in patients with congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation and/or known risk factors for prolongation of the QT interval such as:
Cardiac disease, e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction.Proarrhythmic conditions, e.g., bradycardia (< 50 bpm).History of ventricular dysrhythmias.Uncorrected hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia.Concomitant administration with QT interval prolonging agents [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] as this may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias.Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval. Monitor cardiac function as clinically indicated during hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets therapy. Correct electrolyte imbalances prior to use. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets if cardiotoxicity is suspected.Irreversible retinal damage was observed in some patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate and it is related to cumulative dosage and treatment duration. In patients of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula.Risk factors for retinal damage include daily hydroxychloroquine sulfate dosages =5 mg/kg of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, renal impairment, use of concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate, and concurrent macular disease.
Within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, a baseline ocular examination is recommended including best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For patients at higher risk of retinal damage, monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For patients without significant risk factors, annual retinal exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.
If ocular toxicity is suspected, discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and monitor the patient closely given that retinal changes and visual disturbances may progress even after cessation of therapy.
Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Monitor for serious skin reactions, especially in patients receiving a drug that may also induce dermatitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention promptly if they experience signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions such as blisters on the skin, eyes, lips or in the mouth, itching or burning, with or without fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6)]. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets if these severe reactions occur.
Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe flare-up of psoriasis. Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with porphyria may exacerbate porphyria. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with psoriasis or porphyria, unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible risk.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may cause myelosuppression including aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Monitor blood cell counts periodically in patients on prolonged hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets therapy. If the patient develops myelosuppression which cannot be attributable to the disease, discontinue the drug.
Hemolysis has been reported in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Monitor for hemolytic anemia as this can occur, particularly in association with other drugs that cause hemolysis.
Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have demonstrated bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. If weakness occurs, discontinue the drug.
Suicidal behavior has been reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Alert patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or mood changes. The risk and benefit of continued treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should be assessed for patients who develop these symptoms.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can cause severe and potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia, in the presence or absence of antidiabetic agents [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Measure blood glucose in patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia and as adjust the antidiabetic treatment as necessary. Warn hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets -treated patients about the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; diabetic patients should monitor their blood sugar levels. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they develop any signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolongs the QT interval. There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval or are arrhythmogenic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1].

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may enhance the effects of insulin and antidiabetic drugs, and consequently increase the hypoglycemic risk. Therefore, a decrease in dosage of insulin and other antidiabetic drugs may be necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8
)].
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can lower the seizure threshold. Coadministration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets with other antimalarials known to lower the seizure threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of seizures.
The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if coadministered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.
Concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and methotrexate may increase the incidence of adverse reactions.
An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets were coadministered. Monitor serum cyclosporine levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.
Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels. Monitor serum digoxin levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.
Concomitant use of cimetidine resulted in a 2-fold increase of exposure of chloroquine, which is structurally related to hydroxychloroquine. Interaction of cimetidine with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out. Avoid concomitant use of cimetidine.
Lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine was reported when rifampicin was concomitantly administered. Avoid concomitant use of rifampicin.
Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Interaction of praziquantel with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.
Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Interaction of antacids and kaolin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.
In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. Interaction of ampicillin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.
A reduction in the dosage of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease.
Mechanism of Action in MalariaThe precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.Antimicrobial ActivityHydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite liver stage forms of P. vivax and P. ovale.Drug ResistanceP. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine. Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread [see Indications and Usage (1.1)].Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Tablets USP, 200 mg (equivalent to 155 mg of base), are white to off-white, film-coated, oval, biconvex tablets, debossed with “698 200” on one side and “WATSON” on the other side in bottles of 100 (NDC 0591-3041-01).

"346","040133","Pregnancy Exposure RegistryThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets during pregnancy. Encourage patients to register by contacting 1-877-311-8972.Risk SummaryProlonged clinical experience over decades of use and available data from published epidemiologic and clinical studies with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal, or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated or increased disease activity from malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with hydroxychloroquine.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal RiskMalaria: Malaria during pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal anemia, prematurity, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth.Rheumatoid Arthritis: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus, especially those with increased disease activity, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, fetal death, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Passage of maternal auto-antibodies across the placenta may result in neonatal illness, including neonatal lupus and congenital heart block.DataHuman Data Data from published epidemiologic and clinical studies have not established an association with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Hydroxychloroquine readily crosses the placenta with cord blood levels corresponding to maternal plasma levels. No retinal toxicity, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, or growth and developmental abnormalities have been observed in children who were exposed to hydroxychloroquine in utero. Available epidemiologic and clinical studies have methodological limitations including small sample size and study design.","PREGNANCY SECTION"

However, this product cannot be directly administered to pediatric patients weighing less than 31 kg because the film-coated tablets cannot be crushed or divided [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].The safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, or systemic lupus erythematosus.
","PEDIATRIC USE SECTION"
"349","040133","Clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Nevertheless, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In general, dose selection in geriatric patients should start with the lowest recommended dose, taking into consideration the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.
","GERIATRIC USE SECTION"
"351","040133","Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets overdosage symptoms have an onset within 1–3 hours of ingestion. The following have been reported with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets overdosage:Cardiovascular toxicity, including QRS or QTc prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes, atrioventricular block, cardiac arrest and death.Life-threatening hypotension is common.Severe hypokalemia secondary to an intracellular shift is common in severe toxicity.Central nervous system (CNS) depression, seizures, visual disturbances, transient blindness, and coma may occur.Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures warrant consideration in patients that present within the first hour post-ingestion. If the level of consciousness rapidly deteriorates in severe poisoning, consider intubation before gastrointestinal decontamination procedures. Monitor plasma potassium levels and manage accordingly.

"363","040274","Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the: •Treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium ovale. •Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported. Limitations of Use:Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for: •Treatment of complicated malaria. •Treatment of malaria by chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species [see Microbiology (12.4)].•Treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified. •Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs. •Prevention of relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite liver stage forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].For the most current information about drug resistance, refer to the latest recommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 1.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus in adults. Administer hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets orally with food or milk. Do not crush or divide the tablets.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in pediatric patients less than 31 kg because the lowest available strength (200 mg) exceeds the recommended dose for these patients and it cannot be divided. Treatment must start 2 weeks before travel to an endemic area. Advise the patient to take the prophylaxis dosage once a week, staring 2 weeks prior to travel to the endemic area, on the same day every week, continuing the same weekly dose while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area. The recommended prophylaxis dosage is:•Adult patients: 400 mg once a week •Pediatric patients = 31kg: 6.5 mg/kg actual body weight (up to 400 mg) once a week The dosages for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria are: •Adult patients: Administer 800 mg initially; subsequently administer 400 mg at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 2000 mg). •Pediatric patients = 31 kg: Administer 13 mg/kg (up to 800 mg) initially; subsequently administer 6.5 mg/kg (up to 400 mg) at 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after the initial dose (total dosage = 31 mg/kg -up to 2000 mg). For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary [see Microbiology (12.4)].The recommended dosage is: •Initial dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg daily as a single daily dose or two divided doses. The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months for maximum therapeutic effect. Daily doses exceeding 5 mg/kg (actual weight) of hydroxychloroquine sulfate increase the incidence of retinopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].•Chronic dosage: 200 mg once daily to 400 mg daily, as a single dose or two divided doses. Corticosteroids, salicylates, and other antirheumatic agents may be used concomitantly with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses. The recommended dosage is 200 mg given once daily, or 400 mg given once daily or in two divided doses. Fatal and life-threatening cases of cardiotoxicity, including cardiomyopathy, have been reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. Signs and symptoms of cardiac compromise have occurred during acute and chronic hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets treatment. Patients may present with ventricular hypertrophy, pulmonary hypertension and conduction disorders including sick sinus syndrome. ECG findings include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets have a potential to prolong the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias (including torsades de pointes) have been reported in hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets-treated patients. The magnitude of QT prolongation may increase with increasing concentrations of the drug. Therefore, the recommended dose should not be exceeded [see Adverse Reactions (6)
, Overdosage (10)]. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets administration in patients with congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation and/or known risk factors for prolongation of the QT interval such as:•Cardiac disease, e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction. •Proarrhythmic conditions, e.g., bradycardia (< 50 bpm). •History of ventricular dysrhythmias. •Uncorrected hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia. •Concomitant administration with QT interval prolonging agents [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] as this may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval. Monitor cardiac function as clinically indicated during hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets therapy. Correct electrolyte imbalances prior to use. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets if cardiotoxicity is suspected.Irreversible retinal damage was observed in some patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate and it is related to cumulative dosage and treatment duration. In patients of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula. Risk factors for retinal damage include daily hydroxychloroquine sulfate dosages = 5 mg/kg of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, renal impairment, use of concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate, and concurrent macular disease. Within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, a baseline ocular examination is recommended including best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For patients at higher risk of retinal damage, monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For patients without significant risk factors, annual retinal exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.If ocular toxicity is suspected, discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and monitor the patient closely given that retinal changes and visual disturbances may progress even after cessation of therapy. Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Monitor for serious skin reactions, especially in patients receiving a drug that may also induce dermatitis. Advise patients to seek medical attention promptly if they experience signs and symptoms of serious skin reactions such as blisters on the skin, eyes, lips or in the mouth, itching or burning, with or without fever [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6)]. Discontinue hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets if these severe reactions occur.Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe flare-up of psoriasis. Administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with porphyria may exacerbate porphyria. Avoid hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with psoriasis or porphyria, unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible risk. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may cause myelosuppression including aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia. Monitor blood cell counts periodically in patients on prolonged hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets therapy. If the patient develops myelosuppression which cannot be attributable to the disease, discontinue the drug. Hemolysis has been reported in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. Monitor for hemolytic anemia as this can occur, particularly in association with other drugs that cause hemolysis.Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have demonstrated bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. If weakness occurs, discontinue the drug. Suicidal behavior has been reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Alert patients to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or mood changes. The risk and benefit of continued treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should be assessed for patients who develop these symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can cause severe and potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia, in the presence or absence of antidiabetic agents [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Measure blood glucose in patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia and as adjust the antidiabetic treatment as necessary. Warn hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets-treated patients about the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia; diabetic patients should monitor their blood sugar levels. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they develop any signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolong the QT interval. There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine hydroxychloroquine tablets are used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval or are arrhythmogenic [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.1)
].
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may enhance the effects of insulin and antidiabetic drugs, and consequently increase the hypoglycemic risk. Therefore, a decrease in dosage of insulin and other antidiabetic drugs may be necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can lower the seizure threshold. Co-administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets with other antimalarials known to lower the seizure threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of seizures.The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co-administered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. Concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and methotrexate may increase the incidence of adverse reactions. An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets were co-administered. Monitor serum cyclosporine levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy. Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels. Monitor serum digoxin levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.Concomitant use of cimetidine resulted in a 2-fold increase of exposure of chloroquine, which is structurally related to hydroxychloroquine. Interaction of cimetidine with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out. Avoid concomitant use of cimetidine. Lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine was reported when rifampicin was concomitantly administered. Avoid concomitant use of rifampicin. Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Interaction of praziquantel with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out. Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Interaction of antacids and kaolin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out. In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. Interaction of ampicillin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out. There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets during pregnancy. Encourage patients to register by contacting 1-877-311-8972. NANAMalaria during pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal anemia, prematurity, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth.Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.Pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus, especially those with increased disease activity, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, fetal death, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Passage of maternal auto-antibodies across the placenta may result in neonatal illness, including neonatal lupus and congenital heart block.NAData from published epidemiologic and clinical studies have not established an association with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Hydroxychloroquine readily crosses the placenta with cord blood levels corresponding to maternal plasma levels. No retinal toxicity, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, or growth and developmental abnormalities have been observed in children who were exposed to hydroxychloroquine in utero. Available epidemiologic and clinical studies have methodological limitations including small sample size and study design. A reduction in the dosage of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease. Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline antimalarial [see Microbiology (12.4)] and antirheumatic agent. The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus are not fully known. Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets to healthy male volunteers, whole blood hydroxychloroquine Cmax was 129.6 ng/mL (plasma Cmax was 50.3 ng/mL) with Tmax of 3.3 hours (plasma Tmax 3.7 hours). Following a single oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets dose of 200 mg, the mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74 (compared to administration of 155 mg of hydroxychloroquine intravenous infusion). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e., 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is extensively distributed to tissues.A half-life of 123.5 days in plasma were observed following a single 200 mg oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets dose to healthy male volunteers. Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, the absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days. Significant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) were found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite. Renal clearance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for at least 6 months was similar to that in single dose studies in healthy volunteers, suggesting that no change in clearance occurred with chronic dosing. Renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16% to 30%. NAThe precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA. Hydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite liver stage forms of P. vivax and P. ovale. P. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine. Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread [see Indications and Usage (1.1)].

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated or increased disease activity from malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with hydroxychloroquine. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Published lactation data report that hydroxychloroquine is present in human milk at low levels. No adverse reactions have been reported in breastfed infants. No retinal toxicity, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, or growth and developmental abnormalities have been observed in children who were exposed to hydroxychloroquine through breastmilk. There is no information on the effect of hydroxychloroquine on milk production.

","RISKS"
"408","040274","The safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets have been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale, as well as for the prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported. However, this product cannot be directly administered to pediatric patients weighing less than 31 kg because the film-coated tablets cannot be crushed or divided [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)]. The safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets have not been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, or systemic lupus erythematosus.","PEDIATRIC USE SECTION"
"409","040274","Clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients. Nevertheless, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In general, dose selection in geriatric patients should start with the lowest recommended dose, taking into consideration the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. ","GERIATRIC USE SECTION"
"411","040274","Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets overdosage symptoms have an onset within 1–3 hours of ingestion. The following have been reported with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets overdosage: •Cardiovascular toxicity, including QRS or QTc prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, torsade de pointes, atrioventricular block, cardiac arrest and death. •Life-threatening hypotension is common. •Severe hypokalemia secondary to an intracellular shift is common in severe toxicity. •Central nervous system (CNS) depression, seizures, visual disturbances, transient blindness, and coma may occur. Gastrointestinal decontamination procedures warrant consideration in patients that present within the first hour post-ingestion. If the level of consciousness rapidly deteriorates in severe poisoning, consider intubation before gastrointestinal decontamination procedures. Monitor plasma potassium levels and manage accordingly.

All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.  In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal RiskMalaria: Malaria during pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal anemia, prematurity, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth.Rheumatoid Arthritis: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus, especially those with increased disease activity, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, fetal death, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Passage of maternal auto-antibodies across the placenta may result in neonatal illness, including neonatal lupus and congenital heart block.DataHuman DataData from published epidemiologic and clinical studies have not established an association with hydroxychloroquine sulfate use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Hydroxychloroquine readily crosses the placenta with cord blood levels corresponding to maternal plasma levels.  No retinal toxicity, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, or growth and developmental abnormalities have been observed in children who were exposed to hydroxychloroquine in utero.  Available epidemiologic and clinical studies have methodological limitations including small sample size and study design.","PREGNANCY SECTION"

"436","040657","Clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients.  Nevertheless, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. In general, dose selection in geriatric patients should start with the lowest recommended dose, taking into consideration the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.","GERIATRIC USE SECTION"
"437","040657","Hydroxychloroquine sulfate overdosage symptoms have an onset within 1 hour to 3 hours of ingestion.

"441","040657","AbsorptionFollowing a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to healthy male volunteers, whole blood hydroxychloroquine Cmax was 129.6 ng/mL (plasma Cmax was 50.3 ng/mL) with Tmax of 3.3 hours (plasma Tmax 3.7 hours).  Following a single oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets dose of 200 mg, the mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74 (compared to administration of 155 mg of hydroxychloroquine intravenous infusion). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine.After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1,161 ng/mL to 2,436 ng/mL (mean 1,918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30% to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity.Distributionhydroxychloroquine sulfate is extensively distributed to tissues.EliminationA half-life of 123.5 days in plasma were observed following a single 200 mg oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablet dose to healthy male volunteers. Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, the absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days.MetabolismSignificant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) were found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite.ExcretionRenal clearance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate for at least 6 months was similar to that in single dose studies in healthy volunteers, suggesting that no change in clearance occurred with chronic dosing. Renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16% to 30%.","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"
"442","040657","Mechanism of Action in MalariaThe precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.Antimicrobial ActivityHydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale. hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite liver stage forms of P. vivax and P. ovale.Drug ResistanceP. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine.  Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread [see Indications and Usage (1.1)].","MICROBIOLOGY SECTION"

"450","040766","Rx Only*(Each tablet contains 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, USP equivalent to 155 mg of base) CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGYLike chloroquine phosphate, hydroxychloroquine sulfate is highly active against the erythrocytic forms of 


P. vivax and 


malariae and most strains of 


P. falciparum (but not the gametocytes of 


P. falciparum). 


Hydroxychloroquine sulfate does not prevent relapses in patients with 


vivax or 


malariae malaria because it is not effective against exo-erythrocytic forms of the parasite, nor will it prevent 


vivax or 


malariae infection when administered as a prophylactic. It is highly effective as a suppressive agent in patients with 


vivax or 


malariae malaria, in terminating acute attacks, and significantly lengthening the interval between treatment and relapse. In patients with 


falciparum malaria, it abolishes the acute attack and effects complete cure of the infection, unless due to a resistant strain of 


P. falciparum. 


INDICATIONS AND USAGEHydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute attacks and suppression of malaria. WARNINGSIn recent years, it has been found that certain strains of 


P. falciparum have become resistant to 4-aminoquinoline compounds (including hydroxychloroquine) as shown by the fact that normally adequate doses have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia. Treatment with quinine or other specific forms of therapy is therefore advised for patients infected with a resistant strain of parasites. 


INDICATIONS AND USAGEHydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are useful in patients with the following disorders who have not responded satisfactorily to drugs with less potential for serious side effects: lupus erythematosus (chronic discoid and systemic) and acute or chronic rheumatoid arthritis. WARNINGS PHYSICIANS SHOULD COMPLETELY FAMlLlARlZE THEMSELVES WITH THE COMPLETE CONTENTS OF THIS LEAFLET BEFORE PRESCRlBlNG HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SULFATE TABLETSIrreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received long-term or high-dosage 4-aminoquinoline therapy for discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus, or rheumatoid arthritis. Retinopathy has been reported to be dose-related. When prolonged therapy with any antimalarial compound is contemplated, initial (base line) and periodic (every three months) ophthalmologic examinations (including visual acuity, expert slit-lamp, funduscopic, and visual field tests) should be performed. If there is any indication of abnormality in the visual acuity, visual field, or retinal macular areas (such as pigmentary changes, loss of foveal reflex), or any visual symptoms (such as light flashes and streaks) which are not fully explainable by difficulties of accommodation or corneal opacities, the drug should be discontinued immediately and the patient closely observed for possible progression. Retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may progress even after cessation of therapy. All patients on long-term therapy with this preparation should be questioned and examined periodically, including the testing of knee and ankle reflexes, to detect any evidence of muscular weakness. If weakness occurs, discontinue the drug. In the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, if objective improvement (such as reduced joint swelling, increased mobility) does not occur within six months, the drug should be discontinued. Safe use of the drug in the treatment of juvenile arthritis has not been established.PRECAUTIONS Dermatologic reactions to hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may occur and, therefore, proper care should be exercised when they were administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis. The methods recommended for early diagnosis of ""chloroquine retinopathy"" consist of (1) funduscopic examination of the macula for fine pigmentary disturbances or loss of the foveal reflex and (2) examination of the central visual field with a small red test object for pericentral or paracentral scotoma or determination of retinal thresholds to red. Any unexplained visual symptoms, such as light flashes or streaks should also be regarded with suspicion as possible manifestations of retinopathy. If serious toxic symptoms occur from overdosage or sensitivity, it has been suggested that ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) be administered orally three or four days a week for several months after therapy has been stopped, as acidification of the urine increases renal excretion of the 4-aminoquinoline compounds by 20 to 90 percent. However, caution must be exercised in patients with impaired renal function and/or metabolic acidosis. ADVERSE REACTIONSNot all of the following reactions have been observed with every 4-aminoquinoline compound during long-term therapy, but they have been reported with one or more and should be borne in mind when drugs of this class are administered. Adverse effects with different compounds vary in type and frequency. CNS Reactions: Irritability, nervousness, emotional changes, nightmares, psychosis, headache, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, nystagmus, nerve deafness, convulsions, ataxia. 


Neuromuscular Reactions: Skeletal muscle palsies or skeletal muscle myopathy or neuromyopathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups which may be associated with mild sensory changes, depression of tendon reflexes and abnormal nerve conduction.

","INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION"
"455","040766","Use of this drug is contraindicated (1) in the presence of retinal or visual field changes attributable to any 4-aminoquinoline compound, (2) in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds, and (3) for long-term therapy in children.","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"456","040766","The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion, and in accidental overdosage, or rarely with lower doses in hypersensitive patients, toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes. These consist of headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, and convulsions, followed by sudden and early respiratory and cardiac arrest. The electrocardiogram may reveal atrial standstill, nodal rhythm, prolonged intraventricular conduction time, and progressive bradycardia leading to ventricular fibrillation and/or arrest. Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt with immediate evacuation of the stomach by emesis (at home, before transportation to the hospital) or gastric lavage until the stomach is completely emptied. If finely powdered, activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube, after lavage, and within 30 minutes after ingestion of the tablets, it may inhibit further intestinal absorption of the drug. To be effective, the dose of activated charcoal should be at least five times the estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets that were ingested. Convulsions, if present, should be controlled before attempting gastric lavage. If due to cerebral stimulation, cautious administration of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate may be tried but, if due to anoxia, it should be corrected by oxygen administration, artificial respiration or, in shock with hypotension, by vasopressor therapy. Because of the importance of supporting respiration, tracheal intubation or tracheostomy, followed by gastric lavage, may also be necessary. Exchange transfusions have been used to reduce the level of 4-aminoquinoline drug in the blood. A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least six hours. Fluids may be forced, and sufficient ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine to help promote urinary excretion in cases of both overdosage and sensitivity.MALARIA","OVERDOSAGE SECTION"
"458","040766","Following the administration in doses adequate for the treatment of an acute malarial attack, mild and transient headache, dizziness, and gastrointestinal complaints (diarrhea, anorexia, nausea, abdominal cramps and, on rare occasions, vomiting) may occur. Cardiomyopathy has been rarely reported with high daily dosages of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.","ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION"
"459","040766","One tablet of 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is equivalent to 155 mg base. Malaria: 


Suppression: In adults, 400 mg (=310 mg base) on exactly the same day of each week. 


In infants and children, the weekly suppressive dosage is 5 mg, calculated as base, per kg of body weight, but should not exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. 


If circumstances permit, suppressive therapy should begin two weeks prior to exposure. However, failing this, in adults an initial double (loading) dose of 800 mg (=620 mg base), or in children 10 mg base/kg may be taken in two divided doses, six hours apart. The suppressive therapy should be continued for eight weeks after leaving the endemic area. Treatment of the acute attack: In adults, an initial dose of 800 mg (=620 mg base) followed by 400 mg (=310 mg base) in six to eight hours and 400 mg (=310 mg base) on each of two consecutive days (total 2 g hydroxychloroquine sulfate or 1.55 g base). An alternative method, employing a single dose of 800 mg (=620 mg base), has also proved effective. 


The dosage for adults may also be calculated on the basis of body weight; this method is preferred for infants and children. A total dose representing 25 mg of base per kg of body weight is administered in three days, as follows: First dose: 10 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 620 mg base). Second dose: 5 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 310 mg base) 6 hours after first dose. Third dose: 5 mg base per kg 18 hours after second dose. Fourth dose: 5 mg base per kg 24 hours after third dose.

"467","212902","Pregnancy Exposure RegistryThere is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to hydroxychloroquine sulfate during pregnancy. Encourage patients to register by contacting 1-877-311-8972.Risk SummaryProlonged clinical experience over decades of use and available data from published epidemiologic and clinical studies with hydroxychloroquine sulfate use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal, or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with untreated or increased disease activity from malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). Animal reproduction studies were not conducted with hydroxychloroquine.The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes.  In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk
Malaria: Malaria during pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal anemia, prematurity, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth.Rheumatoid Arthritis: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with rheumatoid arthritis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.Systemic Lupus Erythematosus: Pregnant women with systemic lupus erythematosus, especially those with increased disease activity, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion, fetal death, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and intrauterine growth restriction. Passage of maternal auto-antibodies across the placenta may result in neonatal illness, including neonatal lupus and congenital heart block.DataHuman DataData from published epidemiologic and clinical studies have not established an association with hydroxychloroquine sulfate use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Hydroxychloroquine readily crosses the placenta with cord blood levels corresponding to maternal plasma levels. No retinal toxicity, ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, or growth and developmental abnormalities have been observed in children who were exposed to hydroxychloroquine in utero. Available epidemiologic and clinical studies have methodological limitations including small sample size and study design.","PREGNANCY SECTION"

"474","212902","AbsorptionFollowing a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to healthy male volunteers, whole blood hydroxychloroquine C max was 129.6 ng/mL (plasma C max was 50.3 ng/mL) with T max of 3.3 hours (plasma T max 3.7 hours). Following a single oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate dose of 200 mg, the mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74 (compared to administration of 155 mg of hydroxychloroquine intravenous infusion). Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine.After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity.DistributionHydroxychloroquine sulfate is extensively distributed to tissues.EliminationA half-life of 123.5 days in plasma were observed following a single 200 mg oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate dose to healthy male volunteers. Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, the absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days.MetabolismSignificant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) were found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite.ExcretionRenal clearance in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate for at least 6 months was similar to that in single dose studies in healthy volunteers, suggesting that no change in clearance occurred with chronic dosing. Renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16% to 30%.","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"
"475","212902","Mechanism of Action in MalariaThe precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.Antimicrobial ActivityHydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite liver stage forms of P.

Each scored tablet contains 25 mg pyrimethamine and the inactive ingredients pregelatinized corn starch, magnesium stearate and mannitol.Pyrimethamine, USP known chemically as 5-(4- chlorophenyl)-6-ethyl-2, 4-pyrimidinediamine, has the following structural formula:C12H13ClN4
Mol. Wt. 248.71Patients should be warned that at the first appearance of a skin rash they should stop use of pyrimethamine and seek medical attention immediately. Patients should also be warned that the appearance of sore throat, pallor, purpura, or glossitis may be early indications of serious disorders which require treatment with pyrimethamine to be stopped and medical treatment to be sought. Women of childbearing potential who are taking pyrimethamine should be warned against becoming pregnant. Patients should be warned to keep pyrimethamine out of the reach of children. Patients should be advised not to exceed recommended doses. Patients should be warned that if anorexia and vomiting occur, they may be minimized by taking the drug with meals. Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended when used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis in all patients.In patients receiving high dosage, semiweekly blood counts, including platelet counts, should be performed. Clinical studies of pyrimethamine did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"
"484","215506","Pyrimethamine is well absorbed with peak levels occurring between 2 to 6 hours following administration. It is eliminated slowly and has a plasma half-life of approximately 96 hours. Pyrimethamine is 87% bound to human plasma proteins.Microbiology: Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist and the rationale for its therapeutic action is based on the differential requirement between host and parasite for nucleic acid precursors involved in growth. This activity is highly selective against Toxoplasma gondii. The action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides. This was demonstrated by Eyles and Coleman1 in the treatment of experimental toxoplasmosis in the mouse. Jacobs etal2 demonstrated that combination of the 2 drugs effectively prevented the development of severe uveitis in most rabbits following the inoculation of the anterior chamber of the eye with toxoplasma.","CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION"
"485","215506","Treatment of Toxoplasmosis: Pyrimethamine tablets are indicated for the treatment of toxoplasmosis when used conjointly with a sulfonamide, since synergism exists with this combination.","INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION"
"486","215506","Use of pyrimethamine tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pyrimethamine or to any component of the formulation. Use of the drug is also contraindicated in patients with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency.","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"487","215506","The dosage of pyrimethamine required for the treatment of toxoplasmosis has a narrow therapeutic window. If signs of folate deficiency develop (see ADVERSE REACTIONS), reduce the dosage or discontinue the drug according to the response of the patient. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered in a dosage of 5 to 15 mg daily (orally, intravenous, or intramuscular) until normal hematopoiesis is restored.Data in 2 humans indicate that pyrimethamine may be carcinogenic; a 51-year-old female who developed chronic granulocytic leukemia after taking pyrimethamine for 2 years for toxoplasmosis3 and a 56-year-old patient who developed reticulum cell sarcoma after 14 months of pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis.4
Pyrimethamine has been reported to produce a significant increase in the number of lung tumors in mice when given intraperitoneally at doses of 25 mg/kg.5
Pyrimethamine tablets should be kept out of the reach of infants and children as they are extremely susceptible to adverse effects from an overdose. Deaths in pediatric patients have been reported after accidental ingestion.","WARNINGS SECTION"
"488","215506","A small “starting” dose for toxoplasmosis is recommended in patients with convulsive disorders to avoid the potential nervous system toxicity of pyrimethamine. Pyrimethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function or in patients with possible folate deficiency, such as individuals with malabsorption syndrome, alcoholism, or pregnancy, and those receiving therapy, such as phenytoin, affecting folate levels (see Pregnancy subsection).","GENERAL PRECAUTIONS SECTION"
"491","215506","Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine and other antimalarials, and with other antibiotics. However, the concomitant use of other antifolic drugs or agents associated with myelosuppression including sulfonamides or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combinations, proguanil, zidovudine, or cytostatic agents (e.g., methotrexate), while the patient is receiving pyrimethamine, may increase the risk of bone marrow suppression. If signs of folate deficiency develop, pyrimethamine should be discontinued. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored (see WARNINGS). Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients when lorazepam and pyrimethamine were administered concomitantly.","DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION"
"492","215506","See WARNINGS section for information on carcinogenesis. Mutagenesis: Pyrimethamine has been shown to be nonmutagenic in the following in vitro assays: the Ames point mutation assay, the Rec assay, and the E. coli WP2 assay. It was positive in the L5178Y/TK +/- mouse lymphoma assay in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation.6 Human blood lymphocytes cultured in vitro had structural chromosome aberrations induced by pyrimethamine.In vivo, chromosomes analyzed from the bone marrow of rats dosed with pyrimethamine showed an increased number of structural and numerical aberrations.","CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY SECTION"
"493","215506","Teratogenic Effects: Pyrimethamine has been shown to be teratogenic in rats when given in oral doses 2.5 times the human dose for treatment of toxoplasmosis. At these doses in rats, there was a significant increase in abnormalities such as cleft palate, brachygnathia, oligodactyly, and microphthalmia. Pyrimethamine has also been shown to produce terata such as meningocele in hamsters and cleft palate in miniature pigs when given in oral doses 5 times the human dose for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Pyrimethamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended when used during pregnancy.","PREGNANCY SECTION"
"494","215506","Pyrimethamine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from pyrimethamine and from concurrent use of a sulfonamide with pyrimethamine for treatment of some patients with toxoplasmosis, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS
: 
Pregnancy).","NURSING MOTHERS SECTION"
"495","215506","See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.","PEDIATRIC USE SECTION"
"497","215506","Hypersensitivity reactions, occasionally severe (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, and anaphylaxis), and hyperphenylalaninemia, can occur particularly when pyrimethamine is administered concomitantly with a sulfonamide. Consult the complete prescribing information for the relevant sulfonamide for sulfonamide-associated adverse events. With doses of pyrimethamine used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, anorexia and vomiting may occur. Vomiting may be minimized by giving the medication with meals; it usually disappears promptly upon reduction of dosage. Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, atrophic glossitis, hematuria, and disorders of cardiac rhythm.Hematologic effects, however, may also occur at low doses in certain individuals (see PRECAUTIONS

General). Pulmonary eosinophilia has been reported rarely.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS, contact Teva at 1-888-838-2872 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch for voluntary reporting of adverse reactions.","ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION"
"498","215506","Following the ingestion of 300 mg or more of pyrimethamine, gastrointestinal and/or central nervous system signs may be present, including convulsions. The initial symptoms are usually gastrointestinal and may include abdominal pain, nausea, severe and repeated vomiting, possibly including hematemesis. Central nervous system toxicity may be manifest by initial excitability, generalized and prolonged convulsions which may be followed by respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, and death within a few hours. Neurological symptoms appear rapidly (30 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion), suggesting that in gross overdosage pyrimethamine has a direct toxic effect on the central nervous system.The fatal dose is variable, with the smallest reported fatal single dose being 375 mg. There are, however, reports of pediatric patients who have recovered after taking 375 to 625 mg.There is no specific antidote to acute pyrimethamine poisoning. In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. Gastric lavage is recommended and is effective if carried out very soon after drug ingestion. Parenteral diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Folinic acid should be administered within 2 hours of drug ingestion to be most effective in counteracting the effects on the hematopoietic system (see WARNINGS). Due to the long half-life of pyrimethamine, daily monitoring of peripheral blood counts is recommended for up to several weeks after the overdose until normal hematologic values are restored.","OVERDOSAGE SECTION"
"499","215506","For Treatment of Toxoplasmosis: The dosage of pyrimethamine tablets for the treatment of toxoplasmosis must be carefully adjusted so as to provide maximum therapeutic effect and a minimum of side effects. At the dosage required, there is a marked variation in the tolerance to the drug. Young patients may tolerate higher doses than older individuals. Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended in all patients.The adult starting dose is 50 to 75 mg of the drug daily, together with 1 to 4 g daily of a sulfonamide of the sulfapyrimidine type, e.g. sulfadoxine. This dosage is ordinarily continued for 1 to 3 weeks, depending on the response of the patient and tolerance to therapy. The dosage may then be reduced to about one half that previously given for each drug and continued for an additional 4 to 5 weeks.The pediatric dosage of pyrimethamine tablets is 1 mg/kg/day divided into 2 equal daily doses; after 2 to 4 days this dose may be reduced to one half and continued for approximately 1 month.

In this trial, elevated levels of amylase occurred in subjects (8% versus 4%) receiving atovaquone tablets or pentamidine, respectively.Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin and atovaquone oral suspension is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations 


[see 


CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]


. Concomitant administration of atovaquone oral suspension and rifampin or rifabutin is not recommended.


Concomitant administration of tetracycline and atovaquone oral suspension has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone 


[see 


CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 


Caution should be used when prescribing tetracycline concomitantly with atovaquone oral suspension. Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of atovaquone if coadministration is necessary.


Metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available 


[see 


CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)].



Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and C


max of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the C


trough of indinavir 


[see 


CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. 


Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone oral suspension with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir. Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of indinavir if coadministration with atovaquone oral suspension is necessary.


Risk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing experience with use of atovaquone in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes 


(see 


Clinical Considerations)


. Atovaquone given orally by gavage to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations at plasma concentrations up to 3 times and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations 


(see 


Data)


.


The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of severe illness and maternal death associated with PCP compared with non-pregnant women.DataAnimal Data:Atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day [GD] 6 to GD15) did not cause maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma concentrations approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure during the treatment of PCP based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In pregnant rabbits, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 300, 600, and 1,200 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD18) caused decreased fetal body length at a maternally toxic dose of 1,200 mg/kg/day corresponding to a plasma concentration that is approximately 0.5 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In a pre-and post-natal study in rats, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from GD15 until Lactation Day (LD) 20 did not impair the growth or developmental effects in first generation offspring at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations during the treatment of PCP. Atovaquone crossed the placenta and was present in fetal rat and rabbit tissue.Risk SummaryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1. There are no data on the presence of atovaquone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.Atovaquone was detected in rat milk when lactating rats were administered oral atovaquone 


(see 


Data)


. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the potential for HIV-1 transmission to HIV-negative infants, instruct mothers with HIV-1 not to breastfeed if they are taking atovaquone for the prevention or treatment of PCP.


DataIn a rat study with doses of 10 and 250 mg/kg given orally by gavage on postpartum Day 11, atovaquone concentrations in the milk were 30% of the concurrent atovaquone concentrations in the maternal plasma at both doses. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.Relationship between Plasma Atovaquone Concentrations and Clinical OutcomeIn a comparative clinical trial, HIV/AIDS subjects received atovaquone tablets 750 mg 3 times daily or TMP-SMX for treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP for 21 days 


[see 


CLINICAL STUDIES (14.2)]


; the relationship between atovaquone plasma concentrations and successful treatment outcome from 113 of these subjects for whom both steady-state drug concentrations and outcome data were available is shown in Table 6.

Successful Treatment


Successful treatment outcome was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Improvement in clinical and respiratory measures was assessed using a composite of parameters that included oral body temperature, respiratory rate, and severity scores for cough, dyspnea, and chest pain/tightness.

The mean (±SD) absolute bioavailability of atovaquone from a 750-mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension administered under fed conditions in 9 HIV-1-infected (CD4 >100 cells/mm


3) volunteers was 47% ± 15%.


Effect of Food:Administering atovaquone oral suspension with food enhances atovaquone bioavailability. Sixteen healthy subjects received a single 750-mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension after an overnight fast and following a meal (23 g fat: 610 kCal). The mean (±SD) atovaquone AUC under fasting and fed conditions were 324 ± 115 and 801 ± 320 h·mcg/mL, respectively, representing a 2.6 ± 1.0-fold increase.DistributionFollowing IV administration of atovaquone, the mean (±SD) volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 0.60 ± 0.17 L/kg (n = 9). Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. In 3 HIV-1-infected children who received 750 mg atovaquone as the tablet formulation 4 times daily for 2 weeks, the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of atovaquone were 0.04, 0.14, and 0.26 mcg/mL, representing less than 1% of the plasma concentration.EliminationThe mean (±SD) half-life of atovaquone was 62.5 ± 35.3 hours after IV administration and ranged from 67.0 ± 33.4 to 77.6 ± 23.1 hours following administration of atovaquone oral suspension.Metabolism:The metabolism of atovaquone is unknown.Excretion:Following oral administration of 14C-labelled atovaquone to healthy subjects, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days.Specific PopulationsPatients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment:The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.HIV-Infected Subjects:When atovaquone oral suspension was administered to 5 HIV-1–infected subjects at a dose of 750 mg twice daily, the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration was 21.0 ± 4.9 mcg/mL and mean (±SD) C


max was 24.0 ± 5.7 mcg/mL. The mean (±SD) minimum plasma atovaquone concentration (C


min) associated with the 750-mg twice-daily regimen was 16.7 ± 4.6 mcg/mL.


In an open-label PCP trial in 18 HIV-1–infected subjects, administration of atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg twice daily with meals resulted in a mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration of 22.0 ± 10.1 mcg/mL.The mean (±SD) plasma clearance of atovaquone following IV administration in 9 HIV-1–infected subjects was 10.4 ± 5.5 mL/min (0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg).Drug Interaction StudiesRifampin/Rifabutin:In a trial with 13 HIV-1-infected volunteers, the oral administration of rifampin 600 mg every 24 hours with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg every 12 hours resulted in a 52% ± 13% decrease in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 37% ± 42% increase in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma rifampin concentration. The half-life of atovaquone decreased from 82 ± 36 hours when administered without rifampin to 50 ± 16 hours with rifampin. In a trial of 24 healthy volunteers, the oral administration of rifabutin 300 mg once daily with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg twice daily resulted in a 34% decrease in the mean steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 19% decrease in the mean steady-state plasma rifabutin concentration.Tetracycline:Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.Metoclopramide:Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with a 50% reduction in steady-state atovaquone plasma concentrations.Indinavir:Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and C


max of indinavir, but resulted in a decrease in the C


trough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI: 8%, 35%]).


Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX):Concomitant administration of atovaquone oral suspension 500 mg once daily (not the approved dosage) and TMP-SMX in 6 HIV-infected adult subjects did not result in significant changes in either atovaquone or TMP-SMX exposure.Zidovudine:The administration of atovaquone tablets 750 mg every 12 hours with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours to 14 HIV-1 infected subjects resulted in a 24% ± 12% decrease in zidovudine apparent oral clearance, leading to a 35% ± 23% increase in plasma zidovudine AUC. The glucuronide metabolite:parent ratio decreased from a mean of 4.5 when zidovudine was administered alone to 3.1 when zidovudine was administered with atovaquone tablets. This effect is minor and would not be expected to produce clinically significant events. Zidovudine had no effect on atovaquone pharmacokinetics.Mechanism of ActionAtovaquone is a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an analog of ubiquinone, with antipneumocystis activity. The mechanism of action against 


Pneumocystis jirovecii has not been fully elucidated. In 


Plasmodium species, the site of action appears to be the cytochrome 


bc
1 complex (Complex III). Several metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone results in indirect inhibition of these enzymes. The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.


Antimicrobial ActivityAtovaquone is active against 


P. jirovecii [see 


CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].



ResistancePhenotypic resistance to atovaquone in vitro has not been demonstrated for 


P. jirovecii. However, in 2 subjects who developed PCP after prophylaxis with atovaquone, DNA sequence analysis identified mutations in the predicted amino acid sequence of 


P. jirovecii cytochrome 


b (a likely target site for atovaquone). The clinical significance of this is unknown.


Impairment of FertilityAtovaquone administered by oral gavage in doses of 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day toadult malerats from 73 days prior to mating until 20 days after mating and to adult female rats from 14 days prior to mating until LD20 did not impair male or female fertility or early embryonic development at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures of approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations.The indication for prevention of PCP is based on the results of 2 clinical trials comparing atovaquone oral suspension with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV-1-infected adolescent (aged 13 to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP (CD4 count <200 cells/mm


3 or a prior episode of PCP) and unable to tolerate TMP-SMX.


Dapsone Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 1,057 subjects, randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 536) or dapsone 100 mg once daily (n = 521). The majority of subjects were white (64%), male (88%), and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization (73%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 24 months. Subjects randomized to the dapsone arm who were seropositive for 


Toxoplasma gondii and had a CD4 count <100 cells/mm


3 also received pyrimethamine and folinic acid. PCP event rates are shown in Table 7. Mortality rates were similar.


Aerosolized Pentamidine Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 549 subjects, randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 175), atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg once daily (n = 188), or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg once monthly (n = 186). The majority of subjects were white (79%), male (92%), and were primary prophylaxis patients at enrollment (58%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 11.3 months. The results of the PCP event rates appear in Table 7. Mortality rates were similar among the groups.Table 7. Confirmed or Presumed/Probable PCP Events (As-Treated Analysis)

An analysis of all PCP events (intent-to-treat analysis) for both trials showed results similar to those shown in Table 7.The indication for treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP is based on the results of 2 efficacy trials: a randomized, double-blind trial comparing atovaquone tablets with TMP-SMX in subjects with HIV/AIDS and mild-to-moderate PCP (defined in the protocol as [(A-a)DO


2] =45 mm Hg and PaO


2=60 mm Hg on room air) and a randomized open-label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with IV pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials. Both trials were conducted with the tablet formulation using 750 mg 3 times daily. Results from these efficacy trials established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentration and successful outcome. Successful outcome was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy

TMP-SMX Comparative TrialThis double-blind, randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of atovaquone tablets with that of TMP-SMX for the treatment of subjects with HIV/AIDS and histologically confirmed PCP. Only subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP were eligible for enrollment.A total of 408 subjects were enrolled into the trial. The majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Eighty-six subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 322 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP, 160 were randomized to receive 750 mg atovaquone (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days and 162 were randomized to receive 320 mg TMP plus 1,600 mg SMX 3 times daily for 21 days. Therapy success was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Improvement in clinical and respiratory measures was assessed using a composite of parameters that included oral body temperature, respiratory rate, severity scores for cough, dyspnea, and chest pain/tightness. Therapy failures included lack of response, treatment discontinuation due to an adverse experience, and unevaluable.There was a significant difference (


P = 0.03) in mortality rates between the treatment groups favoring TMP-SMX. Among the 322 subjects with confirmed PCP, 13 of 160 (8%) subjects treated with atovaquone and 4 of 162 (2.5%) subjects receiving TMP-SMX died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all 408 randomized subjects, there were 16 (8%) deaths among subjects treated with atovaquone and 7 (3.4%) deaths among subjects treated with TMP-SMX (


P = 0.051). Of the 13 subjects with confirmed PCP and treated with atovaquone who died, 4 died of PCP and 5 died with a combination of bacterial infections and PCP; bacterial infections did not appear to be a factor in any of the 4 deaths among TMP-SMX-treated subjects.


A correlation between plasma atovaquone concentrations and death demonstrated that subjects with lower plasma concentrations were more likely to die. For those subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentration data are available, 5 (63%) of 8 subjects with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 1 (2.0%) of the 49 subjects with Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations =5 mcg/mL died.Sixty-two percent of subjects on atovaquone and 64% of subjects on TMP-SMX were classified as protocol-defined therapy successes (Table 8).Table 8.

Approximately 80% of the subjects either had a history of intolerance to trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials (the primary therapy group) or were experiencing intolerance to TMP-SMX with treatment of an episode of PCP at the time of enrollment in the trial (the salvage treatment group). A total of 174 subjects were enrolled into the trial. Subjects were randomized to receive atovaquone 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or pentamidine isethionate 3- to 4-mg/kg single IV infusion daily for 21 days. The majority of subjects were white (72%) and male (97%); the mean age was approximately 37 years.Thirty-nine subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 135 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP, 70 were randomized to receive atovaquone and 65 to pentamidine. One hundred and ten (110) of these were in the primary therapy group and 25 were in the salvage therapy group. One subject in the primary therapy group randomized to receive pentamidine did not receive trial medication.There was no difference in mortality rates between the treatment groups. Among the 135 subjects with confirmed PCP, 10 of 70 (14%) subjects receiving atovaquone and 9 of 65 (14%) subjects receiving pentamidine died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all subjects, there were 11 (12.5%) deaths among those treated with atovaquone and 12 (14%) deaths among those treated with pentamidine. Among subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations were available, 3 of 5 (60%) subjects with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 2 of 21 (9%) subjects with Day 4 plasma concentrations =5 mcg/mL died.

"576","213342","Pharmacokinetics: Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets to healthy males, the mean peak blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine was 129.6 ng/mL, reached in 3.26 hours with a half-life of 537 hours (22.4 days). In the same study, the plasma peak concentration was 50.3 ng/mL reached in 3.74 hours with a half-life of 2963 hours (123.5 days). Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxycholoquine. The mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74. After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.


Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, significant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) have been found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite. The absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days. The long half-life can be attributed to extensive tissue uptake rather than through decreased excretion. Peak plasma levels of hydroxychloroquine were seen in about 3 to 4 hours. Renal clearance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate for at least six months seemed to be similar to that of the single dose studies in volunteers, suggesting that no change occurs with chronic dosing. Range for renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16 to 30% and did not correlate with creatinine clearance; therefore, a dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment. In RA patients, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity. Cellular levels of patients on daily hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be higher in mononuclear cells than polymorphonuclear leucocytes.","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"

"578","213342","
Mechanism of action:
The precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against 


Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine, like chloroquine, is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.


Mechanism of action: The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate are unknown.


","MECHANISM OF ACTION SECTION"
"579","213342","
Activity in vitro and in Clinical Infections:
Hydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of 


Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and 


Plasmodium vivax. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite stage (


P. vivax and 


P. ovale) of the 


Plasmodium parasites.


Drug Resistance: 


P. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine.


Resistance of 


Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread (see 



INDICATIONS AND USAGE – Malaria).


Patients in whom chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia, or patients who acquired malaria in a geographic area where chloroquine resistance is known to occur should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy (see 



INDICATIONS AND USAGE – Malaria and



WARNINGS).


Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to 


P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and 


P. vivax.


Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported.Limitations of Use in Malaria• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended for the treatment of complicated malaria.


• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not effective against chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of 


Plasmodium species (see 


CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended for the treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the 


Plasmodium species has not been identified.


• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs.


• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate does not prevent relapses of 


P. vivax or 


P. ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite forms of these parasites. For radical cure of 


P. vivax and 


P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary (see 


CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology).


Prior to prescribing hydroxychloroquine sulfate for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Malaria website (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria).Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus in adults.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults.ProphylaxisAdults: 400 mg (310 mg base) once weekly on the same day of each week starting 2 weeks prior to exposure, and continued for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area.


Weight-based dosing in adults and pediatric patients: 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base), not to exceed 400 mg (310 mg base), once weekly on the same day of the week starting 2 weeks prior to exposure, and continued for 4 weeks after leaving the endemic area.


Treatment of Uncomplicated MalariaAdults: 800 mg (620 mg base) followed by 400 mg (310 mg base) at 6 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after the initial dose (total 2000 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate or 1550 mg base).


Weight based dosage in adults and pediatric patients: 13 mg/kg (10 mg/kg base), not to exceed 800 mg (620 mg base) followed by 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base), not to exceed 400 mg (310 mg base), at 6 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after the initial dose. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate film-coated tablets cannot be divided, therefore they should not be used to treat patients who weigh less than 31 kg.


For radical cure of 


P. vivax and 


P. malariae infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary.


The recommended adult dosage is 200 to 400 mg (155 to 310 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. Doses above 400 mg a day are not recommended.The incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded.The action of hydroxychloroquine is cumulative and may require weeks to months to achieve the maximum therapeutic effect (see 


CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).


Initial adult dosage: 400 mg to 600 mg (310 to 465 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses. In a small percentage of patients, side effects may require temporary reduction of the initial dosage.


Maintenance adult dosage: When a good response is obtained, the dosage may be reduced by 50 percent and continued at a maintenance level of 200 mg to 400 mg (155 to 310 mg base) daily, administered as a single daily dose or in two divided doses.


Do not exceed 600 mg or 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) per day, whichever is lower, as the incidence of retinopathy has been reported to be higher when this maintenance dose is exceeded.Corticosteroids and salicylates may be used in conjunction with hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and they can generally be decreased gradually in dosage or eliminated after a maintenance dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate has been achieved.","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"
"582","213342","","INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION"
"586","213342","Use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds.","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"587","213342","Resistant strains of malaria: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of 


P. falciparum (see 



CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology).


Ocular: Irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Significant risk factors for retinal damage include daily doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of some concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate and concurrent macular disease.


A baseline ocular examination is recommended within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The baseline exam should include: best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT).For individuals with significant risk factors (daily dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 5.0 mg/kg base of actual body weight, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of tamoxifen citrate or concurrent macular disease) monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For individuals without significant risk factors, annual exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment.In individuals of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.It is recommended that hydroxychloroquine be discontinued if ocular toxicity is suspected and the patient should be closely observed given that retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may progress even after cessation of therapy.Cardiac Effects, including Cardiomyopathy and QT prolongation: Postmarketing cases of life-threatening and fatal cardiomyopathy have been reported with use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate as well as with use of chloroquine. Patients may present with atrioventricular block, pulmonary hypertension, sick sinus syndrome or with cardiac complications. ECG findings may include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block. Signs or symptoms of cardiac compromise have appeared during acute and chronic treatment. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy is advised, including use of appropriate diagnostic tools such as ECG to monitor patients for cardiomyopathy during hydroxychloroquine sulfate therapy. Chronic toxicity should be considered when conduction disorders (bundle branch block/atrio-ventricular heart block) or biventricular hypertrophy are diagnosed. If cardiotoxicity is suspected, prompt discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate may prevent life-threatening complications.


Hydroxychloroquine sulfate prolongs the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes have been reported in patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate (see 


OVERDOSAGE). Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval (see 


DRUG INTERACTIONS).


Worsening of psoriasis and porphyria: Use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe attack of psoriasis. When used in patients with porphyria the condition may be exacerbated. The preparation should not be used in these conditions unless in the judgment of the physician the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible hazard.


Proximal Myopathy and Neuropathy: Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have been associated with curvilinear bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.


Neuropsychiatric events, including suicidality: Suicidal behavior has been rarely reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.


Hypoglycemia: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate has been shown to cause severe hypoglycemia including loss of consciousness that could be life threatening in patients treated with or without antidiabetic medications (see 


DRUG INTERACTIONS and 


ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be warned about the risk of hypoglycemia and the associated clinical signs and symptoms. Patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should have their blood glucose checked and treatment reviewed as necessary.


","WARNINGS SECTION"
"588","213342","General: Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal, neurological, or blood disorders, and in those with a sensitivity to quinine.Hepatic/Renal Disease: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism, or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. A reduction in dosage may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease, as well as in those taking medicines known to affect these organs.


Hematologic Effects/Laboratory Tests: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. Periodic blood cell counts should be performed if patients are given prolonged therapy. If any severe blood disorder such as aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, appears which is not attributable to the disease under treatment, consider discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate.


Hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be administered with caution in patients having glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency.Dermatologic Effects: Dermatologic reactions to hydroxychloroquine sulfate may occur and, therefore, proper care should be exercised when it is administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis.


","PRECAUTIONS SECTION"
"589","213342","Digoxin: Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels: serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving combined therapy.


Insulin or antidiabetic drugs: As hydroxychloroquine sulfate may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may be required.


Drugs that prolong QT interval and other arrhythmogenic drugs: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate prolongs the QT interval and should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Also, there may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs.


Mefloquine and other drugs known to lower the convulsive threshold: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate can lower the convulsive threshold. Co-administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of convulsions.


Antiepileptics: The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co-administered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.


Methotrexate: Combined use of methotrexate with hydroxychloroquine sulfate has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects.


Cyclosporin: An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate were co-administered.


The following interactions have been observed on treatment with the structurally related substance chloroquine phosphate, and therefore cannot be ruled out for hydroxychloroquine.Praziquantel: Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel.


Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed.


Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided.


Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin.


","DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION"
"590","213342","Information for Patients: Patients should be informed of the early signs and symptoms of toxicity such as rash or visual changes.

","PREGNANCY SECTION"
"594","213342","Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when administering hydroxychloroquine sulfate to nursing women. It has been demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine administered to nursing women is excreted in human milk and it is known that infants are extremely sensitive to the toxic effects of 4-aminoquinolines.


","NURSING MOTHERS SECTION"
"595","213342","Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy have not been established in the chronic use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate for systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children. Children are especially sensitive to the 4-aminoquinoline compounds. Most reported fatalities followed the accidental ingestion of chloroquine, sometimes in small doses (0.75 g or 1 g in one 3-year-old child). Patients should be strongly warned to keep these drugs out of the reach of children (see

","PEDIATRIC USE SECTION"
"596","213342","Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of hydroxychloroquine sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

"598","213342","The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion, and in accidental overdosage, or rarely with lower doses in hypersensitive patients, toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes. The symptoms of overdosage may include headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest. Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt. Immediate gastric lavage until the stomach is completely emptied is indicated. After lavage, activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube within 30 minutes of ingestion of the drug may inhibit further intestinal absorption. To be effective, the dose of activated charcoal should be at least five times the estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine ingested.Consideration should be given to administering diazepam parenterally since studies suggest that it may be beneficial in reversing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity.Respiratory support and shock management should be instituted as necessary.Exchange transfusions are used to reduce the level of 4-aminoquinoline drug in the blood.A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least six hours. Fluids may be forced and sufficient ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine.

"606","090612","Chloroquine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and only a small proportion of the administered dose is found in the stools. Approximately 55% of the drug inthe plasma is bound to nondiffusible plasma constituents. Excretion of chloroquine is quite slow,but is increased by acidification of the urine. Chloroquine is deposited in the tissues in considerable amounts. In animals, from 200 to 700 times the plasma concentration may be found in the liver,spleen, kidney, and lung; leukocytes also concentrate the drug. The brain and spinal cord, in contrast, contain only 10 to 30 times the amount present in plasma.Chloroquine undergoes appreciable degradation in the body. The main metabolite is desethylchloroquine, which accounts for one fourth of the total material appearing in the urine;bisdesethylchloroquine, a carboxylic acid derivative, and other metabolic products as yet uncharacterized are found in small amounts. Slightly more than half of the urinary drug products can be accounted for as unchanged chloroquine.","CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION"
"607","090612","Mechanism of Action: Chloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline, is an anti-protozoal agent. The precise mechanism by which chloroquine exhibits activity is not known. Chloroquine, may exert its effect against Plasmodium species by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA. Activity in Vitro and in Clinical Infections: Chloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of susceptible strains of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium vivax. Chloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and the exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite stage (P. vivax and P. ovale) of the Plasmodium parasites. In vitro studies with Chloroquine demonstrated that it is active against the trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica.
Drug Resistance: Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Limitations of Use in Malaria and WARNINGS).
Plasmodium parasites exhibiting reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to chloroquine. Patients in whom chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia, or patients who acquired malaria in a geographic area where chloroquine resistance is known to occur should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy (see WARNINGS and INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Limitations of Use).","MECHANISM OF ACTION SECTION"
"608","090612","Chloroquine phosphate tablets are indicated for the: Treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to susceptible strains of P. falciparum, P.malariae, P. ovale, and P.vivax.Prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where resistance to chloroquine is not present.Treatment of extraintestinal amebiasis. Chloroquine phosphate tablets do not prevent relapses in patients with vivax or ovale malaria because it is not effective against exoerythrocytic forms of the parasites.Limitations of Use in Malaria:Do not use chloroquine phosphate tablets for the treatment of complicated malaria (high-grade parasitemia and/or complications e.g., cerebral malaria or acute renal failure).Do not use chloroquine phosphate tablets for malaria prophylaxis in areas where chloroquine resistance occurs, Resistance to chloroquine phosphate tablets is widespread in P. falciparum, and is reported in P.vivax (see WARNINGS).Concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary for treatment of the hypnozoite liver stage forms of P.vivax and P.ovale (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).","INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION"
"609","090612","Use of chloroquine phosphate tablets for indications other than acute malaria is contraindicated in the presence of retinal or visual field changes of any etiology. Use of chloroquine phosphate tablets is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds.","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"610","090612","Chloroquine-Resistant Malaria Chloroquine phosphate tablets are not effective against chloroquine-or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Microbiology). Chloroquine resistance is widespread in P. falciparum and is reported in P. vivax. Before using chloroquine for prophylaxis, it should be ascertained whether chloroquine is appropriate for use in the region to be visited by the traveler. Information regarding the geographic areas where resistance to chloroquine occurs, is available at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov\malaria).Patients infected with a resistant strain of plasmodia as shown by the fact that normally adequate doses have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy.
Treatment of Exo-Erythocytic Forms of Malaria
Chloroquine does not treat the hypnozoite liver stage forms of Plasmodium and will therefore not prevent relapses of malaria due to P. vivax or P. ovale. Additional treatment with an anti-malarial agent active against these forms, such as an 8-aminoquinoline, is required for the treatment of infections with P. vivax and P. ovale.
Cardiac Effects
Cases of cardiomyopathy resulting in cardiac failure, in some cases with fatal outcome, have been reported in patients treated during long term therapy at high doses with chloroquine (see ADVERSE REACTIONS and OVERDOSAGE). Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy and discontinue chloroquine if cardiomyopathy develops. Chronic toxicity should be considered when conduction disorders (bundle branch block / atrio-ventricular heart block) are diagnosed. If cardiotoxicity is suspected, prompt discontinuation of chloroquine may prevent life-threatening complications. QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes, and ventricular arrhythmias have been reported. The risk is greater if chloroquine is administered at high doses. Fatal cases have been reported. Chloroquine should be used with caution in patients with cardiac disease, a history of ventricular arrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia, or bradycardia (<50 bpm), and during concomitant administration with QT interval prolonging agents due to potential for QT interval prolongation (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, ADVERSE REACTIONS and OVERDOSAGE)
Hypoglycemia
Chloroquine has been shown to cause severe hypoglycemia including loss of consciousness that could be life-threatening in patients treated with or without antidiabetic medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Patients treated with chloroquine phosphate tablets should be warned about the risk of hypoglycemia and the associated clinical signs and symptoms. Patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during treatment with chloroquine should have their blood glucose level checked and treatment reviewed as necessary.
Retinopathy1

Irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received chloroquine. Significant risk factors for retinal damage include daily doses of chloroquine phosphate greater than 2.3 mg/kg of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of some concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate (see PRECAUTIONS), and concurrent macular disease. A baseline ophthalmological examination should be performed within the first year of starting chloroquine phosphate tablets. The baseline exam should include: best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For individuals with significant risk factors (daily dose of chloroquine phosphate greater than 2.3 mg/kg of actual body weight, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of tamoxifen citrate or concurrent macular disease) monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SDOCT. For individuals without significant risk factors, annual exams (including BCVA, VF and SD-OCT) can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In individuals of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees. It is recommended that chloroquine be discontinued if ocular toxicity is suspected and the patient should be closely observed given that retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may progress even after cessation of therapy.
Central Nervous System Effects
Acute extrapyramidal disorders may occur with chloroquine (see PRECAUTIONS, ADVERSE REACTIONS and OVERDOSAGE). These adverse reactions usually resolve after treatment discontinuation and/or symptomatic treatment.
Muscular Weakness
All patients on long-term therapy with chloroquine should be questioned and examined periodically, including testing knee and ankle reflexes, to detect any evidence of muscular weakness. If weakness occurs, discontinue the drug.
Pediatric Accidental Ingestion
A number of fatalities have been reported following the accidental ingestion of chloroquine, sometimes in relatively small doses (0.75 g or 1 g chloroquine phosphate in one 3-year-old child). Patients should be strongly warned to keep chloroquine phosphate tablets out of the reach of children because they are especially sensitive to the 4-aminoquinoline compounds (see OVERDOSAGE and ADVERSE REACTIONS).
Worsening of Psoriasis and Porphyria
Use of chloroquine phosphate tablets in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe attack of psoriasis. When used in patients with porphyria the condition may be exacerbated. Chloroquine phosphate tablets should not be used in these conditions unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the potential risks.","WARNINGS SECTION"
"611","090612","Usage in Pregnancy Usage of chloroquine during pregnancy should be avoided except in the prophylaxis or treatment of malaria when the benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. Radioactively tagged chloroquine administered intravenously to pregnant pigmented CBA mice passed rapidly across the placenta and accumulated selectively in the melanin structures of the fetal eyes. It was retained in the ocular tissues for five months after the drug had been eliminated from the rest of the body2. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of chloroquine in pregnant women.","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"
"612","090612","NAHematological Effects/Laboratory Tests Complete blood cell counts should be checked periodically if patients are given prolonged therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Chloroquine may cause hemolysis in glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency. Blood monitoring may be needed as hemolytic anemia may occur, in particular in association with other drugs that cause hemolysis (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).Auditory Effects In patients with preexisting auditory damage, chloroquine should be administered with caution. In case of any defects in hearing, chloroquine should be immediately discontinued, and the patient closely observed (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment Since chloroquine phosphate tablets are known to concentrate in the liver, it should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs.Central Nervous System Effects Chloroquine may increase the risk of convulsions in patients with a history of epilepsy.Drug Interactions Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed.Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided.Insulin and other antidiabetic drugs: As chloroquine may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses of insulin or other antidiabetic drugs may be required.
Arrhythmogenic drugs: There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if chloroquine is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs, such as amiodarone or moxifloxacin.
Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. An interval of at least two hours between intake of ampicillin and chloroquine should be observed.Cyclosporine: After introduction of chloroquine (oral form), a sudden increase in serum cyclosporine level has been reported. Therefore, close monitoring of serum cyclosporine level is recommended and, if necessary, chloroquine should be discontinued.Mefloquine: Co-administration of chloroquine and mefloquine may increase the risk of convulsions.The blood concentrations of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine (the major metabolite of chloroquine, which also has antimalarial properties) were negatively associated with log antibody titers. Chloroquine taken in the dose recommended for malaria prophylaxis can reduce the antibody response to primary immunization with intradermal human diploid-cell rabies vaccine.
Praziquantel: In a single-dose interaction study, chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel.
Tamoxifen: Concomitant use of chloroquine with drugs known to induce retinal toxicity such as tamoxifen is not recommended (see WARNINGS).PregnancySee WARNINGS, Usage in Pregnancy.Nursing Mothers Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from chloroquine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the potential clinical benefit of the drug to the mother.The excretion of chloroquine and the major metabolite, desethylchloroquine, in breast milk wasinvestigated in eleven lactating mothers following a single oral dose of chloroquine (600 mg base). The maximum daily dose of the drug that the infant can receive from breastfeeding was about 0.7% of the maternal start dose of the drug in malaria chemotherapy. Separate chemoprophylaxis for the infant is required (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).   Pediatric UseSee WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
Geriatric UseClinical studies of Chloroquine phosphate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, this drugis known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug maybe greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to havedecreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitorrenal function.","PRECAUTIONS SECTION"
"622","090612","The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of chloroquine or other 4-aminoqunoline compounds. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
Ocular disorders: Maculopathy and macular degeneration have been reported and may be irreversible. Irreversible retinopathy with retinal pigmentation changes (bull’s eye appearance) and visual field defects (paracentral scotomas) in patients receiving long-term or high-dosage 4-aminoquinoline therapy have been reported (see WARNINGS). Visual disturbances (blurring of vision and difficulty of focusing or accommodation); nyctalopia; scotomatous vision with field defects of paracentral, pericentral ring types, and typically temporal scotomas (e.g., difficulty in reading with words tending to disappear, seeing half an object, misty vision, and fog before the eyes) have been reported. Reversible corneal opacities have also been reported.
Immune system disorders: Urticaria, anaphylactic reaction including angioedema.
Ear and labyrinth disorders: Nerve type deafness; tinnitus, reduced hearing in patients with preexisting auditory damage.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue-disorders: Sensorimotor disorders, skeletal muscle myopathy or neuromyopathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depression of tendon reflexes and abnormal nerve conduction.
Gastrointestinal disorders: Hepatitis, increased liver enzymes, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps.
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis. Pleomorphic skin eruptions, skin and mucosal pigmentary changes; lichen planus-like eruptions, pruritus,; drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome); photosensitivity and hair loss and bleaching of hair pigment.
Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, reversible agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficient patients (see PRECAUTIONS).
Nervous system disorders: Convulsions, mild and transient headache, polyneuropathy, acute extrapyramidal disorders (such as dystonia, dyskinesia, tongue protrusion, torticollis) (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE).
Neuropsychiatric disorders: Neuropsychiatric changes including psychosis, delirium, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, confusion, hallucinations, personality changes, depression, and suicidal behavior.
Cardiac disorders: Hypotension, electrocardiographic changes (particularly, inversion or depression of the T-wave with widening of the QRS complex), and cardiomyopathy (which may result in cardiac failure and in some cases a fatal outcome). Cardiac arrhythmias, conduction disorders such as bundle branch block / atrio-ventricular block, QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have been reported with therapeutic doses of chloroquine as well as with overdose. The risk is greater if chloroquine is administered at high doses. Fatal cases have been reported (see WARNINGS, Cardiac Effects and OVERDOSAGE).
Metabolic and Nutritional disorders: Hypoglycemia (see WARNINGS).","ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION"
"623","090612","Signs and Symptoms: Chloroquine is very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion. Toxic doses of chloroquine can be fatal. As little as 1 g may be fatal in children. Toxic symptoms can occur within minutes. The symptoms of overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest. Immediate medical attention is required, as these effects may appear shortly after the overdose. Cases of extrapyramidal disorders have also been reported in the context of chloroquine overdose (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS).
Treatment: Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt with immediate evacuation of the stomach by emesis or gastric lavage followed by treatment with activated charcoal. Chloroquine overdose is a life-threatening emergency and should be managed with cardio-respiratory and hemodynamic support, monitoring of potassium along with management of arrhythmias and convulsions, as necessary. A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed until all clinical features of toxicity resolve.","OVERDOSAGE SECTION"
"624","090612","The dosage of chloroquine phosphate is often expressed in terms of equivalent chloroquine base. Each 500 mg tablet of Chloroquine phosphate contains the equivalent of 300 mg chloroquine base. In infants and children the dosage is preferably calculated by body weight.
Prophylaxis against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium species Prophylaxis against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium species

Adult Dose: The dosage for prophylaxis is 500 mg (= 300 mg base) administered once per week on exactly the same day of each week.
Pediatric Dose: The dosage for prophylaxis is 5 mg calculated as base, per kg of body weight, administered once per week on exactly the same day of each week. The pediatric dose should never exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. If circumstances permit, suppressive therapy should begin two weeks prior to exposure. However, failing this in adults, an initial double (loading) dose of 1 g (= 600 mg base), or in children 10 mg base/kg may be taken in two divided doses, six hours apart. The suppressive therapy should be continued for eight weeks after leaving the endemic area.
Treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium species

Adults: An initial dose of 1 g salt (= 600 mg base) followed by an additional 500 mg (= 300 mg base) after six to eight hours and a single dose of 500 mg (= 300 mg base) on each of two consecutive days. This represents a total dose of 2.5 g chloroquine phosphate or 1.5 g base in three days.
Infants and Children: In infants and children, the recommended dose is 10 mg base/kg followed by 5 mg based/kg at 6, 24 and 36 hours (total dose 25 mg based/kg). The pediatric dose should never exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. The dosage for adults of low body weight and for infants and children should be determined as follows: First dose: 10 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 600 mg base). Second dose: (6 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 300 mg base). Third dose: (24 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg. Fourth dose: (36 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg.
P. vivax and P. ovale: Concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary for treatment of the hypnozoite liver stage forms of the parasites.
Extraintestinal Amebiasis: Adults Dosage: 1 g salt (600 mg base) daily for two days, followed by 500 mg (300 mg base) daily for at least two to three weeks. Treatment is usually combined with an effective intestinal amebicide.

Subjects received atovaquone 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or a 3- to 4-mg/kg single pentamidine isethionate IV infusion daily for 21 days; the median durations of exposure were 21 and 14 days, respectively.Table 4 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by =10% of the primary therapy trial population regardless of attribution. Fewer subjects who received atovaquone reported adverse reactions than subjects who received pentamidine (63% vs. 72%). However, only 7% of subjects discontinued treatment with atovaquone due to adverse reactions, while 41% of subjects who received pentamidine discontinued treatment for this reason. Of the 5 subjects who discontinued therapy with atovaquone, 3 reported rash (4%). Rash was not severe in any subject. The most frequently cited reasons for discontinuation of pentamidine therapy were hypoglycemia (11%) and vomiting (9%).Table 4.

Risk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing experience with use of atovaquone in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes 














(see 














Clinical Considerations)














. Atovaquone given orally by gavage to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations at plasma concentrations up to 3 times and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations 














(see 














Data)














.














The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of severe illness and maternal death associated with PCP compared with non-pregnant women.DataAnimal Data:Atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day [GD] 6 to GD15) did not cause maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma concentrations approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure during the treatment of PCP based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In pregnant rabbits, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 300, 600, and 1,200 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD18) caused decreased fetal body length at a maternally toxic dose of 1,200 mg/kg/day corresponding to a plasma concentration that is approximately 0.5 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In a pre-and post-natal study in rats, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from GD15 until Lactation Day (LD) 20 did not impair the growth or developmental effects in first generation offspring at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations during the treatment of PCP. Atovaquone crossed the placenta and was present in fetal rat and rabbit tissue.Risk SummaryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1. There are no data on the presence of atovaquone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production.Atovaquone was detected in rat milk when lactating rats were administered oral atovaquone 














(see 














Data)














. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the potential for HIV-1 transmission to HIV-negative infants, instruct mothers with HIV-1 not to breastfeed if they are taking atovaquone for the prevention or treatment of PCP.














DataIn a rat study with doses of 10 and 250 mg/kg given orally by gavage on postpartum Day 11, atovaquone concentrations in the milk were 30% of the concurrent atovaquone concentrations in the maternal plasma at both doses. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.Relationship between Plasma Atovaquone Concentrations and Clinical OutcomeIn a comparative clinical trial, HIV/AIDS subjects received atovaquone tablets 750 mg 3 times daily or TMP-SMX for treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP for 21 days

Effect of Food:Administering atovaquone oral suspension with food enhances atovaquone bioavailability. Sixteen healthy subjects received a single 750-mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension after an overnight fast and following a meal (23 g fat: 610 kCal). The mean (±SD) atovaquone AUC under fasting and fed conditions were 324 ± 115 and 801 ± 320 h·mcg/mL, respectively, representing a 2.6 ± 1.0-fold increase.DistributionFollowing IV administration of atovaquone, the mean (±SD) volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 0.60 ± 0.17 L/kg (n = 9). Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. In 3 HIV-1-infected children who received 750 mg atovaquone as the tablet formulation 4 times daily for 2 weeks, the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of atovaquone were 0.04, 0.14, and 0.26 mcg/mL, representing less than 1% of the plasma concentration.EliminationThe mean (±SD) half-life of atovaquone was 62.5 ± 35.3 hours after IV administration and ranged from 67.0 ± 33.4 to 77.6 ± 23.1 hours following administration of atovaquone oral suspension.Metabolism:The metabolism of atovaquone is unknown.Excretion:Following oral administration of 14C-labelled atovaquone to healthy subjects, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days.Specific PopulationsPatients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment:The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.HIV-Infected Subjects:When atovaquone oral suspension was administered to 5 HIV-1–infected subjects at a dose of 750 mg twice daily, the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration was 21.0 ± 4.9 mcg/mL and mean (±SD) C














max was 24.0 ± 5.7 mcg/mL. The mean (±SD) minimum plasma atovaquone concentration (C














min) associated with the 750-mg twice-daily regimen was 16.7 ± 4.6 mcg/mL.














In an open-label PCP trial in 18 HIV-1–infected subjects, administration of atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg twice daily with meals resulted in a mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration of 22.0 ± 10.1 mcg/mL.The mean (±SD) plasma clearance of atovaquone following IV administration in 9 HIV-1–infected subjects was 10.4 ± 5.5 mL/min (0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg).Drug Interaction StudiesRifampin/Rifabutin:In a trial with 13 HIV-1-infected volunteers, the oral administration of rifampin 600 mg every 24 hours with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg every 12 hours resulted in a 52% ± 13% decrease in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 37% ± 42% increase in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma rifampin concentration. The half-life of atovaquone decreased from 82 ± 36 hours when administered without rifampin to 50 ± 16 hours with rifampin. In a trial of 24 healthy volunteers, the oral administration of rifabutin 300 mg once daily with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg twice daily resulted in a 34% decrease in the mean steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 19% decrease in the mean steady-state plasma rifabutin concentration.Tetracycline:Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.Metoclopramide:Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with a 50% reduction in steady-state atovaquone plasma concentrations.Indinavir:Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and C














max of indinavir, but resulted in a decrease in the C














trough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI: 8%, 35%]).














Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX):Concomitant administration of atovaquone oral suspension 500 mg once daily (not the approved dosage) and TMP-SMX in 6 HIV-infected adult subjects did not result in significant changes in either atovaquone or TMP-SMX exposure.Zidovudine:The administration of atovaquone tablets 750 mg every 12 hours with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours to 14 HIV-1 infected subjects resulted in a 24% ± 12% decrease in zidovudine apparent oral clearance, leading to a 35% ± 23% increase in plasma zidovudine AUC. The glucuronide metabolite:parent ratio decreased from a mean of 4.5 when zidovudine was administered alone to 3.1 when zidovudine was administered with atovaquone tablets. This effect is minor and would not be expected to produce clinically significant events. Zidovudine had no effect on atovaquone pharmacokinetics.Mechanism of ActionAtovaquone is a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an analog of ubiquinone, with antipneumocystis activity. The mechanism of action against 














Pneumocystis jirovecii has not been fully elucidated. In 














Plasmodium species, the site of action appears to be the cytochrome 














bc
1 complex (Complex III). Several metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone results in indirect inhibition of these enzymes. The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.

Impairment of FertilityAtovaquone administered by oral gavage in doses of 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day toadult malerats from 73 days prior to mating until 20 days after mating and to adult female rats from 14 days prior to mating until LD20 did not impair male or female fertility or early embryonic development at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures of approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations.The indication for prevention of PCP is based on the results of 2 clinical trials comparing atovaquone oral suspension with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV-1-infected adolescent (aged 13 to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP (CD4 count <200 cells/mm

Dapsone Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 1,057 subjects, randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 536) or dapsone 100 mg once daily (n = 521). The majority of subjects were white (64%), male (88%), and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization (73%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 24 months.

TMP-SMX Comparative TrialThis double-blind, randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of atovaquone tablets with that of TMP-SMX for the treatment of subjects with HIV/AIDS and histologically confirmed PCP. Only subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP were eligible for enrollment.A total of 408 subjects were enrolled into the trial. The majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Eighty-six subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 322 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP, 160 were randomized to receive 750 mg atovaquone (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days and 162 were randomized to receive 320 mg TMP plus 1,600 mg SMX 3 times daily for 21 days. Therapy success was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Improvement in clinical and respiratory measures was assessed using a composite of parameters that included oral body temperature, respiratory rate, severity scores for cough, dyspnea, and chest pain/tightness. Therapy failures included lack of response, treatment discontinuation due to an adverse experience, and unevaluable.There was a significant difference ( 








P = 0.03) in mortality rates between the treatment groups favoring TMP-SMX. Among the 322 subjects with confirmed PCP, 13 of 160 (8%) subjects treated with atovaquone and 4 of 162 (2.5%) subjects receiving TMP-SMX died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all 408 randomized subjects, there were 16 (8%) deaths among subjects treated with atovaquone and 7 (3.4%) deaths among subjects treated with TMP-SMX ( 








P = 0.051). Of the 13 subjects with confirmed PCP and treated with atovaquone who died, 4 died of PCP and 5 died with a combination of bacterial infections and PCP; bacterial infections did not appear to be a factor in any of the 4 deaths among TMP-SMX-treated subjects.








A correlation between plasma atovaquone concentrations and death demonstrated that subjects with lower plasma concentrations were more likely to die. For those subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentration data are available, 5 (63%) of 8 subjects with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 1 (2.0%) of the 49 subjects with Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations =5 mcg/mL died.Sixty-two percent of subjects on atovaquone and 64% of subjects on TMP-SMX were classified as protocol-defined therapy successes (Table 8).Table 8.

Approximately 80% of the subjects either had a history of intolerance to trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials (the primary therapy group) or were experiencing intolerance to TMP-SMX with treatment of an episode of PCP at the time of enrollment in the trial (the salvage treatment group). A total of 174 subjects were enrolled into the trial. Subjects were randomized to receive atovaquone 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or pentamidine isethionate 3- to 4-mg/kg single IV infusion daily for 21 days. The majority of subjects were white (72%) and male (97%); the mean age was approximately 37 years.Thirty-nine subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 135 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP, 70 were randomized to receive atovaquone and 65 to pentamidine. One hundred and ten (110) of these were in the primary therapy group and 25 were in the salvage therapy group. One subject in the primary therapy group randomized to receive pentamidine did not receive trial medication.There was no difference in mortality rates between the treatment groups. Among the 135 subjects with confirmed PCP, 10 of 70 (14%) subjects receiving atovaquone and 9 of 65 (14%) subjects receiving pentamidine died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all subjects, there were 11 (12.5%) deaths among those treated with atovaquone and 12 (14%) deaths among those treated with pentamidine. Among subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations were available, 3 of 5 (60%) subjects with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 2 of 21 (9%) subjects with Day 4 plasma concentrations =5 mcg/mL died. The therapeutic outcomes for the 134 subjects who received trial medication in this trial are presented in Table 9.Table 9.

Inactive Ingredients:  croscarmellose sodium, dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, maize starch, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc and titanium dioxide.FDA approved dissolution test method differs from the USP dissolution test method.","DESCRIPTION SECTION"
"700","210577","Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to healthy males, the mean peak blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine was 129.6 ng/mL, reached in 3.26 hours with a half-life of 537 hours (22.4 days). In the same study, the plasma peak concentration was 50.3 ng/mL reached in 3.74 hours with a half-life of 2,963 hours (123.5 days). Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. The mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74. After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1,161 ng/mL to 2,436 ng/mL (mean 1,918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, significant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) have been found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite. The absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days. The long half-life can be attributed to extensive tissue uptake rather than through decreased excretion. Peak plasma levels of hydroxychloroquine were seen in about 3 to 4 hours. Renal clearance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate for at least six months seemed to be similar to that of the single dose studies in volunteers, suggesting that no change occurs with chronic dosing. Range for renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16% to 30% and did not correlate with creatinine clearance; therefore, a dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment. In RA patients, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 % to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity. Cellular levels of patients on daily hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be higher in mononuclear cells than polymorphonuclear leucocytes.Microbiology - Malaria Mechanism of action: The precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine, like chloroquine, is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA. Activity in vitro and in Clinical Infections: Hydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium vivax. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite stage (P. vivax and P. ovale) of the Plasmodium parasites. Drug Resistance: P. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine. Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE – Malaria
). Patients in whom chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia, or patients who acquired malaria in a geographic area where chloroquine resistance is known to occur should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE
– Malaria
and WARNINGS).Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Mechanism of action: The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate are unknown. ","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, USP are not effective against chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology
). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, USP are not recommended for the treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, USP are not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, USP do not prevent relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology
). Prior to prescribing hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, USP for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Malaria website (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus in adults. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Clinical studies of hydroxychloroquine sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"
"704","210577","Use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds. ","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"705","210577","Resistant strains of malaria: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology
). Ocular: Irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Significant risk factors for retinal damage include daily doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of some concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate and concurrent macular disease.A baseline ocular examination is recommended within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The baseline exam should include: best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For individuals with significant risk factors (daily dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 5.0 mg/kg base of actual body weight, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of tamoxifen citrate or concurrent macular disease) monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For individuals without significant risk factors, annual exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In individuals of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees. It is recommended that hydroxychloroquine be discontinued if ocular toxicity is suspected and the patient should be closely observed given that retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may progress even after cessation of therapy. Cardiac Effects, including Cardiomyopathy and QT prolongation: Postmarketing cases of life-threatening and fatal cardiomyopathy have been reported with use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate as well as with use of chloroquine. Patients may present with atrioventricular block, pulmonary hypertension, sick sinus syndrome or with cardiac complications. ECG findings may include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block. Signs or symptoms of cardiac compromise have appeared during acute and chronic treatment. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy is advised, including use of appropriate diagnostic tools such as ECG to monitor patients for cardiomyopathy during hydroxychloroquine sulfate therapy. Chronic toxicity should be considered when conduction disorders (bundle branch block/atrio-ventricular heart block) or biventricular hypertrophy are diagnosed. If cardiotoxicity is suspected, prompt discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate may prevent life-threatening complications. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate prolongs the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes have been reported in patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate (see OVERDOSAGE). Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). Worsening of psoriasis and porphyria: Use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe attack of psoriasis. When used in patients with porphyria the condition may be exacerbated. The preparation should not be used in these conditions unless in the judgment of the physician the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible hazard. Proximal Myopathy and Neuropathy: Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have been associated with curvilinear bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Neuropsychiatric events, including suicidality: Suicidal behavior has been rarely reported in patients treated with  hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Hypoglycemia:Hydroxychloroquine sulfate has been shown to cause severe hypoglycemia including loss of consciousness that could be life threatening in patients treated with or without antidiabetic medications (see DRUG INTERACTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be warned about the risk of hypoglycemia and the associated clinical signs and symptoms. Patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should have their blood glucose checked and treatment reviewed as necessary.","WARNINGS SECTION"
"706","210577","Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal, neurological, or blood disorders, and in those with a sensitivity to quinine. Hepatic/Renal Disease: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. A reduction in dosage may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease, as well as in those taking medicines known to affect these organs.Hematologic Effects/Laboratory Tests: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. Periodic blood cell counts should be performed if patients are given prolonged therapy. If any severe blood disorder such as aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, appears which is not attributable to the disease under treatment, consider discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be administered with caution in patients having glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency. Dermatologic Effects:Dermatologic reactions to hydroxychloroquine sulfate may occur and, therefore, proper care should be exercised when it is administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis.","GENERAL PRECAUTIONS SECTION"
"707","210577","Digoxin: Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels: serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving combined therapy. Insulin or antidiabetic drugs: As hydroxychloroquine sulfate may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may be required. Drugs that prolong QT interval and other arrhythmogenic drugs: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate prolongs the QT interval and should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Also, there may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs. Mefloquine and other drugs known to lower the convulsive threshold: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate can lower the convulsive threshold. Co-administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of convulsions. Antiepileptics: The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co-administered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.Methotrexate: Combined use of methotrexate with hydroxychloroquine sulfate has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Cyclosporin: An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate were co-administered. The following interactions have been observed on treatment with the structurally related substance chloroquine phosphate, and therefore cannot be ruled out for hydroxychloroquine. Praziquantel: Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided. Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. Information for Patients:Patients should be informed of the early signs and symptoms of toxicity such as rash or visual changes. Patients must see their physicians promptly in case of the appearance of these or of any unusual effects. Periodic laboratory tests may be recommended in some patients. Patients should be fully informed of the potential risks of the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, especially in pregnancy and in children. ","DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION"
"708","210577","Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxychloroquine sulfate.The mutagenic potential of hydroxychloroquine was not evaluated. However, chloroquine has been shown to be a catalytic inhibitor of DNA repair enzymes (topoisomerase II) and to produce weak genotoxic effects through this mode of action.","CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY SECTION"

"720","201691","Pharmacokinetics:Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets to healthy males, the mean peak blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine was 129.6 ng/mL, reached in 3.26 hours with a half-life of 537 hours (22.4 days). In the same study, the plasma peak concentration was 50.3 ng/mL reached in 3.74 hours with a half-life of 2963 hours (123.5 days). Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. The mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74. After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, significant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) have been found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite. The absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days. The long half-life can be attributed to extensive tissue uptake rather than through decreased excretion. Peak plasma levels of hydroxychloroquine were seen in about 3 to 4 hours. Renal clearance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for at least six months seemed to be similar to that of the single dose studies in volunteers, suggesting that no change occurs with chronic dosing.Range for renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16 to 30% and did not correlate with creatinine clearance; therefore, a dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment. In RA patients, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity. Cellular levels of patients on daily hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be higher in mononuclear cells than polymorphonuclear leucocytes.Microbiology – MalariaMechanism of action: The precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine, like chloroquine, is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.Activity in vitro and in Clinical Infections: Hydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium vivax. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite stage (P. vivax and P. ovale) of the Plasmodium parasites.Drug Resistance: P. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine.Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE – Malaria).Patients in whom chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia, or patients who acquired malaria in a geographic area where chloroquine resistance is known to occur should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE –Malaria and WARNINGS).Rheumatoid Arthritis and Systemic Lupus ErythematosusMechanism of action: The mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are unknown.","CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION"
"721","201691","MalariaHydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. vivax. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance is not reported. Limitations of Use in Malaria• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for the treatment of complicated malaria.• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not effective against chloroquine or hydroxychloroquineresistant strains of Plasmodium species (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for the treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified.• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs.• Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets do not prevent relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology). Prior to prescribing hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Malaria website (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria). Lupus ErythematosusHydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus in adults. Rheumatoid ArthritisHydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis in adults.CONTRAINDICATIONSUse of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds.WARNINGSResistant strains of malaria: hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not effective against chloroquineresistant strains of P. falciparum (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology). Ocular: Irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Significant risk factors for retinal damage include daily doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of some concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate and concurrent macular disease. A baseline ocular examination is recommended within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. The baseline exam should include: best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT). For individuals with significant risk factors (daily dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 5.0 mg/kg base of actual body weight, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of tamoxifen citrate or concurrent macular disease) monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For individuals without significant risk factors, annual exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment. In individuals of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees. It is recommended that hydroxychloroquine be discontinued if ocular toxicity is suspected and the patient should be closely observed given that retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may progress even after cessation of therapy. Cardiac Effects, including Cardiomyopathy and QT prolongation: Postmarketing cases of life-threatening and fatal cardiomyopathy have been reported with use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets as well as with use of chloroquine. Patients may present with atrioventricular block, pulmonary hypertension, sick sinus syndrome or with cardiac complications. ECG findings may include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block. Signs or symptoms of cardiac compromise have appeared during acute and chronic treatment. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy is advised, including use of appropriate diagnostic tools such as ECG to monitor patients for cardiomyopathy during Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Tablets therapy. Chronic toxicity should be considered when conduction disorders (bundle branch block/atrio-ventricular heart block) or biventricular hypertrophy are diagnosed. If cardiotoxicity is suspected, prompt discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may prevent lifethreatening complications. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolong the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes have been reported in patients taking Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate Tablets (see OVERDOSAGE). Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). Worsening of psoriasis and porphyria: Use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe attack of psoriasis. When used in patients with porphyria the condition may be exacerbated. The preparation should not be used in these conditions unless in the judgment of the physician the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible hazard. Proximal Myopathy and Neuropathy: Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have been associated with curvilinear bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. Neuropsychiatric events, including suicidality: Suicidal behavior has been rarely reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. Hypoglycemia: hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets have been shown to cause severe hypoglycemia including loss of consciousness that could be life threatening in patients treated with or without antidiabetic medications (see DRUG INTERACTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should be warned about the risk of hypoglycemia and the associated clinical signs and symptoms. Patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should have their blood glucose checked and treatment reviewed as necessary.","INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION"
"722","201691","GeneralUse with caution in patients with gastrointestinal, neurological, or blood disorders, and in those with a sensitivity to quinine. Hepatic/Renal Disease: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. A reduction in dosage may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease, as well as in those taking medicines known to affect these organs. Hematologic Effects/Laboratory Tests: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. Periodic blood cell counts should be performed if patients are given prolonged therapy. If any severe blood disorder such as aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, appears which is not attributable to the disease under treatment, consider discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets should be administered with caution in patients having glucose-6- phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency. Dermatologic Effects: Dermatologic reactions to hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may occur and, therefore, proper care should be exercised when it is administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis.Information for PatientsPatients should be informed of the early signs and symptoms of toxicity such as rash or visual changes. Patients must see their physicians promptly in case of the appearance of these or of any unusual effects. Periodic laboratory tests may be recommended in some patients. Patients should be fully informed of the potential risks of the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets, especially in pregnancy and in children.Drug InteractionsDigoxin: Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels: serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving combined therapy. Insulin or antidiabetic drugs: As hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may be required. Drugs that prolong QT interval and other arrhythmogenic drugs: hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolong the QT interval and should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Also, there may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs. Mefloquine and other drugs known to lower the convulsive threshold: hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can lower the convulsive threshold. Coadministration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of convulsions. Antiepileptics: The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co-administered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. Methotrexate: Combined use of methotrexate with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets have not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects. Cyclosporin: An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets were co-administered. The following interactions have been observed on treatment with the structurally related substance chloroquine phosphate, and therefore cannot be ruled out for hydroxychloroquine. Praziquantel: Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided. Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin.Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertilityLong-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets. The mutagenic potential of hydroxychloroquine was not evaluated. However, chloroquine has been shown to be a catalytic inhibitor of DNA repair enzymes (topoisomerase II) and to produce weak genotoxic effects through this mode of action.PregnancyTeratogenic Effects: Human pregnancies resulting in live births have been reported in the literature and no increase in the rate of birth defects has been demonstrated. Embryonic deaths and malformations of anophthalmia and microphthalmia in the offspring have been reported when pregnant rats received large doses of chloroquine.Nursing MothersCaution should be exercised when administering hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets to nursing women. It has been demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine administered to nursing women is excreted in human milk and it is known that infants are extremely sensitive to the toxic effects of 4-aminoquinolines.Pediatric UseSafety and efficacy have not been established in the chronic use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children.

Most reported fatalities followed the accidental ingestion of chloroquine, sometimes in small doses (0.75 g or 1 g in one 3-year-old child). Patients should be strongly warned to keep these drugs out of the reach of children (see OVERDOSAGE).Geriatric UseClinical studies of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.","PRECAUTIONS SECTION"

Treatment of more severe episodes of PCP with atovaquone oral suspension has not been studied. The efficacy of atovaquone oral suspension in subjects who are failing therapy with TMP-SMX has also not been studied.The recommended oral dosage is 1,500 mg (10 mL) once daily administered with food.The recommended oral dosage is 750 mg (5 mL) twice daily (total daily dose = 1,500 mg) administered with food for 21 days.Administer atovaquone oral suspension with food to avoid lower plasma atovaquone concentrations that may limit response to therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Atovaquone oral suspension BottleShake bottle gently before administering the recommended dosage.Absorption of orally administered atovaquone oral suspension is limited but can be significantly increased when the drug is taken with food. Failure to administer atovaquone oral suspension with food may result in lower plasma atovaquone concentrations and may limit response to therapy. Consider therapy with other agents in patients who have difficulty taking atovaquone oral suspension with food or in patients who have gastrointestinal disorders that may limit absorption of oral medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes, and fatal liver failure have been reported in patients treated with atovaquone [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].
If treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, closely monitor patients following administration of atovaquone.Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.Additionally, because many subjects who participated in clinical trials with atovaquone had complications of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse reactions caused by atovaquone from those caused by underlying medical conditions.PCP Prevention TrialsIn 2 clinical trials, atovaquone oral suspension was compared with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV-1-infected adolescent (13 to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or a prior episode of PCP) and unable to tolerate TMP-SMX.Dapsone Comparative Trial: In the dapsone comparative trial (n = 1,057), the majority of subjects were white (64%), male (88%), and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization (73%); the mean age was 38 years. Subjects received atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 536) or dapsone 100 mg once daily (n = 521); median durations of exposure were 6.7 and 6.5 months, respectively. Adverse reaction data were collected only for adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment, which occurred at similar frequencies in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension or dapsone (Table 1). Among subjects taking neither dapsone nor atovaquone at enrollment (n = 487), adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in 43% of subjects treated with dapsone and 20% of subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting) were more frequently reported in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension (Table 1).Aerosolized Pentamidine Comparative Trial: In the aerosolized pentamidine comparative trial (n = 549), the majority of subjects were white (79%), male (92%), and were primary prophylaxis patients at enrollment (58%); the mean age was 38 years. Subjects received atovaquone oral suspension once daily at a dose of 750 mg (n = 188) or 1,500 mg (n = 175) or received aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg every 4 weeks (n = 186); the median durations of exposure were 6.2, 6.0, and 7.8 months, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by =20% of the subjects receiving either the 1,500-mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension or aerosolized pentamidine.Rash occurred more often in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension (46%) than in subjects treated with aerosolized pentamidine (28%). Treatment-limiting adverse reactions occurred in 25% of subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily and in 7% of subjects treated with aerosolized pentamidine. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily were rash (6%), diarrhea (4%), and nausea (3%). The most frequent adverse reaction requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving aerosolized pentamidine was bronchospasm (2%).Other reactions occurring in =10% of subjects receiving the recommended dose of atovaquone oral suspension (1,500 mg once daily) included vomiting, sweating, flu syndrome, sinusitis, pruritus, insomnia, depression, and myalgia.PCP Treatment TrialsSafety information is presented from 2 clinical efficacy trials of the atovaquone tablet formulation: 1) a randomized, double-blind trial comparing atovaquone tablets with TMP-SMX in subjects with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and mild-to-moderate PCP [(A-a)DO2] =45 mm Hg and PaO2 =60 mm Hg on room air; 2) a randomized, open-label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with intravenous (IV) pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials.TMP-SMX Comparative Trial: In the TMP-SMX comparative trial (n = 408), the majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Subjects received atovaquone 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or TMP 320 mg plus SMX 1,600 mg 3 times daily for 21 days; median durations of exposure were 21 and 15 days, respectively.Table 3 summarizes all clinical adverse reactions reported by =10% of the trial population regardless of attribution. Nine percent of subjects who received atovaquone and 24% of subjects who received TMP-SMX discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction. Among the subjects who discontinued, 4% of subjects receiving atovaquone and 8% of subjects in the TMP-SMX group discontinued therapy due to rash.The incidence of adverse reactions with atovaquone oral suspension at the recommended dose (750 mg twice daily) was similar to that seen with the tablet formulation.Two percent of subjects treated with atovaquone and 7% of subjects treated with TMP-SMX had therapy prematurely discontinued due to elevations in ALT/AST.Pentamidine Comparative Trial: In the pentamidine comparative trial (n = 174), the majority of subjects in the primary therapy trial population (n = 145) were white (72%) and male (97%); the mean age was 37 years. Subjects received atovaquone 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or a 3- to 4-mg/kg single pentamidine isethionate IV infusion daily for 21 days; the median durations of exposure were 21 and 14 days, respectively.Table 4 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by =10% of the primary therapy trial population regardless of attribution. Fewer subjects who received atovaquone reported adverse reactions than subjects who received pentamidine (63% vs. 72%). However, only 7% of subjects discontinued treatment with atovaquone due to adverse reactions, while 41% of subjects who received pentamidine discontinued treatment for this reason. Of the 5 subjects who discontinued therapy with atovaquone, 3 reported rash (4%). Rash was not severe in any subject. The most frequently cited reasons for discontinuation of pentamidine therapy were hypoglycemia (11%) and vomiting (9%).Laboratory abnormality was reported as the reason for discontinuation of treatment in 2 of 73 subjects (3%) who received atovaquone, and in 14 of 71 subjects (20%) who received pentamidine. One subject (1%) receiving atovaquone had elevated creatinine and BUN levels and 1 subject (1%) had elevated amylase levels. In this trial, elevated levels of amylase occurred in subjects (8% versus 4%) receiving atovaquone tablets or pentamidine, respectively.The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atovaquone oral suspension. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.Blood and Lymphatic System DisordersMethemoglobinemia, thrombocytopenia.Immune System DisordersHypersensitivity reactions including angioedema, bronchospasm, throat tightness, and urticaria.Eye DisordersVortex keratopathy.Gastrointestinal DisordersPancreatitis.Hepatobiliary DisordersHepatitis, fatal liver failure.Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue DisordersErythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and skin desquamation.Renal and Urinary DisordersAcute renal impairment.Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin and atovaquone oral suspension is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant administration of atovaquone oral suspension and rifampin or rifabutin is not recommended.Concomitant administration of tetracycline and atovaquone oral suspension has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be used when prescribing tetracycline concomitantly with atovaquone oral suspension. Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of atovaquone if coadministration is necessary.Metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone oral suspension with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir. Monitor patients for potential loss of efficacy of indinavir if coadministration with atovaquone oral suspension is necessary.Risk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing experience with use of atovaquone in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations). Atovaquone given orally by gavage to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations at plasma concentrations up to 3 times and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations (see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of severe illness and maternal death associated with PCP compared with non-pregnant women.DataAnimal Data: Atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day [GD] 6 to GD15) did not cause maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma concentrations approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure during the treatment of PCP based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In pregnant rabbits, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 300, 600, and 1,200 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD18) caused decreased fetal body length at a maternally toxic dose of 1,200 mg/kg/day corresponding to a plasma concentration that is approximately 0.5 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In a pre-and post-natal study in rats, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from GD15 until Lactation Day (LD) 20 did not impair the growth or developmental effects in first generation offspring at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations during the treatment of PCP. Atovaquone crossed the placenta and was present in fetal rat and rabbit tissue.Risk SummaryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1 infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1. There are no data on the presence of atovaquone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Atovaquone was detected in rat milk when lactating rats were administered oral atovaquone (see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the potential for HIV-1 transmission to HIV-negative infants, instruct mothers with HIV-1 not to breastfeed if they are taking atovaquone for the prevention or treatment of PCP.DataIn a rat study with doses of 10 and 250 mg/kg given orally by gavage on postpartum Day 11, atovaquone concentrations in the milk were 30% of the concurrent atovaquone concentrations in the maternal plasma at both doses. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.Evidence of safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients (aged 12 years and younger) has not been established. In a trial of atovaquone oral suspension administered once daily with food for 12 days to 27 HIV-1-infected, asymptomatic infants and children aged between 1 month and 13 years, the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone were age-dependent. The average steady-state plasma atovaquone concentrations in the 24 subjects with available concentration data are shown in Table 5.Clinical trials of atovaquone did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.Carcinogenicity studies in rats were negative; 24-month studies in mice (dosed with 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg/day), showed treatment-related increases in incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma at all doses tested, which correlated with 1.4 to 3.6 times the average steady-state plasma concentrations in humans during acute treatment of PCP. Atovaquone was negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay, and the cultured human lymphocyte cytogenetic assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.Impairment of FertilityAtovaquone administered by oral gavage in doses of 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day to adult male rats from 73 days prior to mating until 20 days after mating and to adult female rats from 14 days prior to mating until LD20 did not impair male or female fertility or early embryonic development at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures of approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations.The indication for prevention of PCP is based on the results of 2 clinical trials comparing atovaquone oral suspension with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV-1-infected adolescent (aged 13 to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3 or a prior episode of PCP) and unable to tolerate TMP-SMX.Dapsone Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 1,057 subjects, randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 536) or dapsone 100 mg once daily (n = 521). The majority of subjects were white (64%), male (88%), and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization (73%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 24 months. Subjects randomized to the dapsone arm who were seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii and had a CD4 count <100 cells/mm3 also received pyrimethamine and folinic acid. PCP event rates are shown in Table 7. Mortality rates were similar.Aerosolized Pentamidine Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 549 subjects, randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 175), atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg once daily (n = 188), or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg once monthly (n = 186). The majority of subjects were white (79%), male (92%), and were primary prophylaxis patients at enrollment (58%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 11.3 months. The results of the PCP event rates appear in Table 7. Mortality rates were similar among the groups.An analysis of all PCP events (intent-to-treat analysis) for both trials showed results similar to those shown in Table 7.The indication for treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP is based on the results of 2 efficacy trials: a randomized, double-blind trial comparing atovaquone tablets with TMP-SMX in subjects with HIV/AIDS and mild-to-moderate PCP (defined in the protocol as [(A-a)DO2] =45 mm Hg and PaO2 =60 mm Hg on room air) and a randomized open-label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with IV pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials. Both trials were conducted with the tablet formulation using 750 mg 3 times daily. Results from these efficacy trials established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentration and successful outcome. Successful outcome was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Comparative pharmacokinetic trials of the oral suspension and tablet formulations established the currently recommended oral suspension dose of 750 mg twice daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
TMP-SMX Comparative TrialThis double-blind, randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of atovaquone tablets with that of TMP-SMX for the treatment of subjects with HIV/AIDS and histologically confirmed PCP. Only subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP were eligible for enrollment.A total of 408 subjects were enrolled into the trial. The majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Eighty-six subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 322 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP, 160 were randomized to receive 750 mg atovaquone (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days and 162 were randomized to receive 320 mg TMP plus 1,600 mg SMX 3 times daily for 21 days. Therapy success was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Improvement in clinical and respiratory measures was assessed using a composite of parameters that included oral body temperature, respiratory rate, severity scores for cough, dyspnea, and chest pain/tightness. Therapy failures included lack of response, treatment discontinuation due to an adverse experience, and unevaluable.There was a significant difference (P = 0.03) in mortality rates between the treatment groups favoring TMP-SMX. Among the 322 subjects with confirmed PCP, 13 of 160 (8%) subjects treated with atovaquone and 4 of 162 (2.5%) subjects receiving TMP-SMX died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all 408 randomized subjects, there were 16 (8%) deaths among subjects treated with atovaquone and 7 (3.4%) deaths among subjects treated with TMP-SMX (P = 0.051). Of the 13 subjects with confirmed PCP and treated with atovaquone who died, 4 died of PCP and 5 died with a combination of bacterial infections and PCP; bacterial infections did not appear to be a factor in any of the 4 deaths among TMP-SMX-treated subjects.A correlation between plasma atovaquone concentrations and death demonstrated that subjects with lower plasma concentrations were more likely to die. For those subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentration data are available, 5 (63%) of 8 subjects with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 1 (2.0%) of the 49 subjects with Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations =5 mcg/mL died.Sixty-two percent of subjects on atovaquone and 64% of subjects on TMP-SMX were classified as protocol-defined therapy successes (Table 8).The failure rate due to lack of response was significantly higher for subjects receiving atovaquone, while the failure rate due to an adverse reaction was significantly higher for subjects receiving TMP-SMX.Pentamidine Comparative TrialThis unblinded, randomized trial was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of atovaquone with that of pentamidine for the treatment of histologically confirmed mild or moderate PCP in subjects with HIV/AIDS. Approximately 80% of the subjects either had a history of intolerance to trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials (the primary therapy group) or were experiencing intolerance to TMP-SMX with treatment of an episode of PCP at the time of enrollment in the trial (the salvage treatment group). A total of 174 subjects were enrolled into the trial. Subjects were randomized to receive atovaquone 750 mg (three 250-mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or pentamidine isethionate 3- to 4-mg/kg single IV infusion daily for 21 days. The majority of subjects were white (72%) and male (97%); the mean age was approximately 37 years. Thirty-nine subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 135 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP, 70 were randomized to receive atovaquone and 65 to pentamidine. One hundred and ten (110) of these were in the primary therapy group and 25 were in the salvage therapy group. One subject in the primary therapy group randomized to receive pentamidine did not receive trial medication.There was no difference in mortality rates between the treatment groups. Among the 135 subjects with confirmed PCP, 10 of 70 (14%) subjects receiving atovaquone and 9 of 65 (14%) subjects receiving pentamidine died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all subjects, there were 11 (12.5%) deaths among those treated with atovaquone and 12 (14%) deaths among those treated with pentamidine. Among subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations were available, 3 of 5 (60%) subjects with concentrations <5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 2 of 21 (9%) subjects with Day 4 plasma concentrations =5 mcg/mL died. The therapeutic outcomes for the 134 subjects who received trial medication in this trial are presented in Table 9.Manufactured by:KVK-Tech, Inc.110 Terry DriveNewtown, PA 18940Manufacturer’s code: 10702Item ID #: 6306/02    Rev.: 03/2019","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"

"760","210510","AbsorptionAtovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility. The bioavailability of atovaquone oral suspension is highly dependent on formulation and diet. The mean (±SD) absolute bioavailability of a 750-mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension administered under fed conditions in 9 HIV-1-infected (CD4 >100 cells/mm3) volunteers was 47% ± 15%.Effect of Food: Administering atovaquone oral suspension with food enhances atovaquone absorption by approximately 2-fold. In one trial, 16 healthy volunteers received a single dose of 750 mg atovaquone oral suspension after an overnight fast and following a standard breakfast (23 g fat: 610 kCal). The mean (±SD) area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) estimates for atovaquone under fasting and fed conditions were 324 ± 115 and 801 ± 320 h•mcg/mL, respectively, representing a 2.6 ± 1.0-fold increase. The effect of food (23 g fat: 400 kCal) on plasma atovaquone concentrations was also evaluated in a multiple-dose, randomized, crossover trial in 19 HIV-1-infected volunteers (CD4 <200 cells/mm3) receiving daily doses of 500 mg atovaquone oral suspension. Mean (±SD) atovaquone AUC values under fasting and fed conditions were 169 ± 77 and 280 ± 114 h•mcg/mL, respectively. Mean (±SD) maximum plasma atovaquone concentration (Cmax) values under fasting and fed conditions were 8.8 ± 3.7 and 15.1 ± 6.1 mcg/mL, respectively.Dose ProportionalityPlasma atovaquone concentrations do not increase proportionally with dose following ascending repeat-dose administration of atovaquone oral suspension. When atovaquone oral suspension was administered with food at dosage regimens of 500 mg once daily, 750 mg once daily, and 1,000 mg once daily, mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentrations were 11.7 ± 4.8, 12.5 ± 5.8, and 13.5 ± 5.1 mcg/mL, respectively. The corresponding mean (±SD) Cmax concentrations were 15.1 ± 6.1, 15.3 ± 7.6, and 16.8 ± 6.4 mcg/mL. When atovaquone oral suspension was administered to 5 HIV-1-infected volunteers at a dose of 750 mg twice daily, the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration was 21.0 ± 4.9 mcg/mL and mean (±SD) Cmax was 24.0 ± 5.7 mcg/mL. The mean (±SD) minimum plasma atovaquone concentration (Cmin) associated with the 750-mg twice-daily regimen was 16.7 ± 4.6 mcg/mL.DistributionFollowing IV administration of atovaquone, the mean (±SD) volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was 0.60 ± 0.17 L/kg (n = 9). Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. In 3 HIV-1-infected children who received 750 mg atovaquone as the tablet formulation 4 times daily for 2 weeks, the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of atovaquone were 0.04, 0.14, and 0.26 mcg/mL, representing less than 1% of the plasma concentration.EliminationThe mean (±SD) half-life of atovaquone was 62.5 ± 35.3 hours after IV administration and ranged from 67.0 ± 33.4 to 77.6 ± 23.1 hours following administration of atovaquone oral suspension. The half-life of atovaquone is due to presumed enterohepatic cycling and eventual fecal elimination.Metabolism:<U+FEFF>The metabolism of atovaquone is unknown.Excretion: The mean (±SD) plasma clearance of atovaquone following IV administration in 9 HIV-1 infected volunteers was 10.4 ± 5.5 mL/min (0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg). In a trial where 14C-labelled atovaquone was administered to healthy volunteers, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days. There was little or no excretion of atovaquone in the urine (less than 0.6%). Specific PopulationsPatients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.Relationship between Plasma Atovaquone Concentration and Clinical OutcomeIn a comparative trial of atovaquone tablets with TMP-SMX for oral treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP [see Clinical Studies (14.2)], where subjects with HIV/AIDS received atovaquone tablets 750 mg 3 times daily for 21 days, the mean steady-state atovaquone concentration was 13.9 ± 6.9 mcg/mL (n = 133). Analysis of these data established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentration and successful treatment (Table 6).A dosing regimen of atovaquone oral suspension for the treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP was selected to achieve average plasma atovaquone concentrations of approximately 20 mcg/mL, because this plasma concentration was previously shown to be well tolerated and associated with the highest treatment success rates (Table 6). In an open-label PCP treatment trial with atovaquone oral suspension, dosing regimens of 1,000 mg once daily, 750 mg twice daily, 1,500 mg once daily, and 1,000 mg twice daily were explored. The mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration achieved at the 750-mg twice-daily dose given with meals was 22.0 ± 10.1 mcg/mL (n = 18).Drug Interaction StudiesRifampin/Rifabutin: In a trial with 13 HIV-1-infected volunteers, the oral administration of rifampin 600 mg every 24 hours with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg every 12 hours resulted in a 52% ± 13% decrease in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 37% ± 42% increase in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma rifampin concentration. The half-life of atovaquone decreased from 82 ± 36 hours when administered without rifampin to 50 ± 16 hours with rifampin. In a trial of 24 healthy volunteers, the oral administration of rifabutin 300 mg once daily with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg twice daily resulted in a 34% decrease in the average steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 19% decrease in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma rifabutin concentration.Tetracycline: Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.Metoclopramide: Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with decreased bioavailability of atovaquone.Indinavir: Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir, but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI: 8%, 35%]).Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole: The possible interaction between atovaquone and TMP-SMX was evaluated in 6 HIV-1-infected adult volunteers as part of a larger multiple-dose, dose-escalation, and chronic dosing trial of atovaquone oral suspension. In this crossover trial, atovaquone oral suspension 500 mg once daily (not the approved dosage), or TMP-SMX tablets (trimethoprim 160 mg and sulfamethoxazole 800 mg) twice daily, or the combination were administered with food to achieve steady state. No difference was observed in the average steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration after coadministration with TMP-SMX. Coadministration of atovaquone with TMP-SMX resulted in a 17% and 8% decrease in average steady-state concentrations of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in plasma, respectively.Zidovudine:Data from 14 HIV-1-infected volunteers who were given atovaquone tablets 750 mg every 12 hours with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours showed a 24% ± 12% decrease in zidovudine apparent oral clearance, leading to a 35% ± 23% increase in plasma zidovudine AUC. The glucuronide metabolite:parent ratio decreased from a mean of 4.5 when zidovudine was administered alone to 3.1 when zidovudine was administered with atovaquone tablets. This effect is minor and would not be expected to produce clinically significant events. Zidovudine had no effect on atovaquone pharmacokinetics.","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"
"761","210510","Mechanism of ActionAtovaquone is a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an analog of ubiquinone, with antipneumocystis activity. The mechanism of action against Pneumocystis jirovecii has not been fully elucidated. In Plasmodium species, the site of action appears to be the cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III). Several metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone results in indirect inhibition of these enzymes. The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.Antimicrobial ActivityAtovaquone is active against P. jiroveci[see Clinical Studies (14)].ResistancePhenotypic resistance to atovaquone in vitro has not been demonstrated for P. jirovecii. However, in 2 subjects who developed PCP after prophylaxis with atovaquone, DNA sequence analysis identified mutations in the predicted amino acid sequence of P. jirovecii cytochrome b (a likely target site for atovaquone). The clinical significance of this is unknown.","MICROBIOLOGY SECTION"

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in adults and adolescents (aged 13 years and older) who cannot tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).

Atovaquone oral suspension is indicated for the acute oral treatment of mild-to-moderate PCP in adults and adolescents (aged 13 years and older) who cannot tolerate TMP-SMX.Clinical experience with atovaquone for the treatment of PCP has been limited to subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP (alveolar-arterial oxygen diffusion gradient [(A-a)DO

2] = 45 mm Hg). Treatment of more severe episodes of PCP with atovaquone has not been studied. The efficacy of atovaquone in subjects who are failing therapy with TMP-SMX has also not been studied.

The recommended oral dosage is 1,500 mg (10 mL) once daily administered with food.The recommended oral dosage is 750 mg (5 mL) twice daily (total daily dose = 1,500 mg) administered with food for 21 days.Administer atovaquone oral suspension with food to avoid low plasma atovaquone concentrations that may limit response to therapy 


[see Warnings and Precautions 


(5.1), Clinical Pharmacology (


12.3)].

Shake bottle gently before administering the recommended dosage.Absorption of orally administered atovaquone oral suspension is limited but can be significantly increased when the drug is taken with food. Failure to administer atovaquone oral suspension with food may result in lower plasma atovaquone concentrations and may limit response to therapy. Consider therapy with other agents in patients who have difficulty taking atovaquone oral suspension with food or in patients who have gastrointestinal disorders that may limit absorption of oral medications

[see Clinical Pharmacology 
(12.3)].
Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, elevated liver enzymes, and fatal liver failure have been reported in patients treated with atovaquone 

[see Adverse Reactions 
(6.2)].
If treating patients with severe hepatic impairment, closely monitor patients following administration of atovaquone oral suspension.Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Additionally, because many subjects who participated in clinical trials with atovaquone had complications of advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, it was often difficult to distinguish adverse reactions caused by atovaquone from those caused by underlying medical conditions.PCP Prevention Trials In 2 clinical trials, atovaquone oral suspension was compared with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV-1–infected adolescent (13 to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm


3 or a prior episode of PCP) and unable to tolerate TMP-SMX.


Dapsone Comparative Trial: In the dapsone comparative trial (n = 1,057), the majority of subjects were white (64%), male (88%), and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization (73%); the mean age was 38 years. Subjects received atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 536) or dapsone 100 mg once daily (n = 521); median durations of exposure were 6.7 and 6.5 months, respectively. Adverse reaction data were collected only for adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment, which occurred at similar frequencies in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension or dapsone (Table 1). Among subjects taking neither dapsone nor atovaquone at enrollment (n = 487), adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of treatment occurred in 43% of subjects treated with dapsone and 20% of subjects treated with atovaquone oral  suspension. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions (nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting) were more frequently reported in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension (Table 1).

Subjects received atovaquone oral suspension once daily at a dose of 750 mg (n = 188) or 1,500 mg (n = 175) or received aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg every 4 weeks (n = 186); the median durations of exposure were 6.2, 6, and 7.8 months, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by = 20% of the subjects receiving either the 1,500 mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension or aerosolized pentamidine.


Rash occurred more often in subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension (46%) than in subjects treated with aerosolized pentamidine (28%). Treatment-limiting adverse reactions occurred in 25% of subjects treated with atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily and in 7% of subjects treated with aerosolized pentamidine. The most frequent adverse reactions requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily were rash (6%), diarrhea (4%), and nausea (3%). The most frequent adverse reaction requiring discontinuation of dosing in the group receiving aerosolized pentamidine was bronchospasm (2%).Table 2.

2] = 45 mm Hg and PaO


2 = 60 mm Hg on room air; 2) a randomized, open-label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with intravenous (IV) pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials.


TMP-SMX Comparative Trial: In the TMP-SMX comparative trial (n = 408), the majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Subjects received atovaquone 750 mg (three 250 mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or TMP 320 mg plus SMX 1,600 mg 3 times daily for 21 days; median durations of exposure were 21 and 15 days, respectively.


Table 3 summarizes all clinical adverse reactions reported by = 10% of the trial population regardless of attribution. Nine percent of subjects who received atovaquone and 24% of subjects who received TMP-SMX discontinued therapy due to an adverse reaction. Among the subjects who discontinued, 4% of subjects receiving atovaquone and 8% of subjects in the TMP-SMX group discontinued therapy due to rash.The incidence of adverse reactions with atovaquone oral suspension at the recommended dose (750 mg twice daily) was similar to that seen with the tablet formulation.Table 3.

Subjects received atovaquone 750 mg (three 250 mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or a 3 mg to 4 mg/kg single pentamidine isethionate IV infusion daily for 21 days; the median durations of exposure were 21 and 14 days, respectively.


Table 4 summarizes the clinical adverse reactions reported by = 10% of the primary therapy trial population regardless of attribution. Fewer subjects who received atovaquone reported adverse reactions than subjects who received pentamidine (63% vs. 72%). However, only 7% of subjects discontinued treatment with atovaquone due to adverse reactions, while 41% of subjects who received pentamidine discontinued treatment for this reason. Of the 5 subjects who discontinued therapy with atovaquone, 3 reported rash (4%). Rash was not severe in any subject. The most frequently cited reasons for discontinuation of pentamidine therapy were hypoglycemia (11%) and vomiting (9%).Table 4.

One subject (1%) receiving atovaquone had elevated creatinine and BUN levels and 1 subject (1%) had elevated amylase levels. In this trial, elevated levels of amylase occurred in subjects (8% versus 4%) receiving atovaquone tablets or pentamidine, respectively.The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of atovaquone oral suspension.

The indication for prevention of PCP is based on the results of 2 clinical trials comparing atovaquone oral suspension with dapsone or aerosolized pentamidine in HIV-1-infected adolescent (aged 13 years to 18 years) and adult subjects at risk of PCP (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm


3 or a prior episode of PCP) and unable to tolerate TMP-SMX. 


Dapsone Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 1,057 subjects, randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 536) or dapsone 100 mg once daily (n = 521). The majority of subjects were white (64%), male (88%), and receiving prophylaxis for PCP at randomization (73%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 24 months. Subjects randomized to the dapsone arm who were seropositive for 


Toxoplasma gondii and had a CD4 count < 100 cells/mm


3 also received pyrimethamine and folinic acid. PCP event rates are shown in Table 7. Mortality rates were similar.


Aerosolized Pentamidine Comparative TrialThis open-label trial enrolled 549 subjects, randomized to receive atovaquone oral suspension 1,500 mg once daily (n = 175), atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg once daily (n = 188), or aerosolized pentamidine 300 mg once monthly (n = 186). The majority of subjects were white (79%), male (92%), and were primary prophylaxis patients at enrollment (58%); the mean age was 38 years. Median follow-up was 11.3 months. The results of the PCP event rates appear in Table 7. Mortality rates were similar among the groups.

2] 45 mm Hg and PaO


2 60 mm Hg on room air) and a randomized open-label trial comparing atovaquone tablets with IV pentamidine isethionate in subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP who could not tolerate trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials. Both trials were conducted with the tablet formulation using 750 mg 3 times daily. Results from these efficacy trials established a relationship between plasma atovaquone concentrations and successful outcome. Successful outcome was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy

TMP-SMX Comparative TrialThis double-blind, randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of atovaquone tablets with that of TMP-SMX for the treatment of subjects with HIV/AIDS and histologically confirmed PCP. Only subjects with mild-to-moderate PCP were eligible for enrollment.A total of 408 subjects were enrolled into the trial. The majority of subjects were white (66%) and male (95%); the mean age was 36 years. Eighty-six subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 322 subjects with histologically confirmed PCP, 160 were randomized to receive 750 mg atovaquone (three 250 mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days and 162 were randomized to receive 320 mg TMP plus 1,600 mg SMX 3 times daily for 21 days. Therapy success was defined as improvement in clinical and respiratory measures persisting at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy. Improvement in clinical and respiratory measures was assessed using a composite of parameters that included oral body temperature, respiratory rate, severity scores for cough, dyspnea, and chest pain/tightness. Therapy failures included lack of response, treatment discontinuation due to an adverse experience, and unevaluable.There was a significant difference (


P = 0.03) in mortality rates between the treatment groups favoring TMP-SMX. Among the 322 subjects with confirmed PCP, 13 of 160 (8%) subjects treated with atovaquone and 4 of 162 (2.5%) subjects receiving TMP-SMX died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all 408 randomized subjects, there were 16 (8%) deaths among subjects treated with atovaquone and 7 (3.4%) deaths among subjects treated with TMP-SMX (


P = 0.051). Of the 13 subjects with confirmed PCP and treated with atovaquone who died, 4 died of PCP and 5 died with a combination of bacterial infections and PCP; bacterial infections did not appear to be a factor in any of the 4 deaths among TMP-SMXtreated subjects.


A correlation between plasma atovaquone concentrations and death demonstrated that subjects with lower plasma concentrations were more likely to die. For those subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentration data are available, 5 (63%) of 8 subjects with concentrations < 5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 1 (2%) of the 49 subjects with Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations 5 mcg/mL died.Sixty-two percent of subjects on atovaquone and 64% of subjects on TMP-SMX were classified as protocol-defined therapy successes (Table 8).

Pentamidine Comparative Trial
This unblinded, randomized trial was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of atovaquone with that of pentamidine for the treatment of histologically-confirmed mild or moderate PCP in subjects with HIV/AIDS. Approximately 80% of the subjects either had a history of intolerance to trimethoprim or sulfa antimicrobials (the primary therapy group) or were experiencing intolerance to TMP-SMX with treatment of an episode of PCP at the time of enrollment in the trial (the salvage treatment group). A total of 174 subjects were enrolled into the trial. Subjects were randomized to receive atovaquone 750 mg (three 250 mg tablets) 3 times daily for 21 days or pentamidine isethionate 3 mg to 4 mg/kg single IV infusion daily for 21 days. The majority of subjects were white (72%) and male (97%); the mean age was approximately 37 years. Thirty-nine subjects without histologic confirmation of PCP were excluded from the efficacy analyses. Of the 135 subjects with histologically-confirmed PCP, 70 were randomized to receive atovaquone and 65 to pentamidine. One hundred and ten (110) of these were in the primary therapy group and 25 were in the salvage therapy group. One subject in the primary therapy group randomized to receive pentamidine did not receive trial medication.There was no difference in mortality rates between the treatment groups. Among the 135 subjects with confirmed PCP, 10 of 70 (14%) subjects receiving atovaquone and 9 of 65 (14%) subjects receiving pentamidine died during the 21-day treatment course or 8-week follow-up period. In the intent-to-treat analysis for all subjects, there were 11 (12.5%) deaths among those treated with atovaquone and 12 (14%) deaths among those treated with pentamidine. Among subjects for whom Day 4 plasma atovaquone concentrations were available, 3 of 5 (60%) subjects with concentrations < 5 mcg/mL died during participation in the trial. However, only 2 of 21 (9%) subjects with Day 4 plasma concentrations 5 mcg/mL died. The therapeutic outcomes for the 134 subjects who received trial medication in this trial are presented in Table 9.

"789","212918","Risk SummaryAvailable data from postmarketing experience with use of atovaquone in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes 


(see Clinical Considerations). Atovaquone given orally by gavage to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis did not cause fetal malformations at plasma concentrations up to 3 times and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations 


(see Data).


The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.Clinical ConsiderationsDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Pregnant women with HIV who are infected with PCP are at increased risk of severe illness and maternal death associated with PCP compared with non-pregnant women.


DataAnimal Data: Atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1,000 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats during organogenesis (Gestation Day [GD] 6 to GD15) did not cause maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma concentrations approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure during the treatment of PCP based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In pregnant rabbits, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, and 1,200 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD18) caused decreased fetal body length at a maternally toxic dose of 1,200 mg/kg/day corresponding to a plasma concentration that is approximately 0.5 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations. In a pre-and post-natal study in rats, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from GD15 until Lactation Day (LD) 20 did not impair the growth or developmental effects in first generation offspring at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 3 times the estimated human exposure based on steady-state plasma concentrations during the treatment of PCP. Atovaquone crossed the placenta and was present in fetal rat and rabbit tissue.


","PREGNANCY SECTION"
"790","212918","Risk SummaryThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-1


–infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV-1. There are no data on the presence of atovaquone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. Atovaquone was detected in rat milk when lactating rats were administered oral atovaquone 


(see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. Because of the potential for HIV-1 transmission to HIV-negative infants, instruct mothers with HIV-1 not to breastfeed if they are taking atovaquone for the prevention or treatment of PCP.


DataIn a rat study with doses of 10 mg and 250 mg/kg given orally by gavage on postpartum Day 11, atovaquone concentrations in the milk were 30% of the concurrent atovaquone concentrations in the maternal plasma at both doses. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.","LACTATION SECTION"

"797","212918","Plasma atovaquone concentrations do not increase proportionally with dose following ascending repeat-dose administration of atovaquone oral suspension in healthy subjects. When atovaquone oral suspension was administered with food at dosage regimens of 500 mg once daily, 750 mg once daily, and 1,000 mg once daily, mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentrations were 11.7 ± 4.8, 12.5 ± 5.8, and 13.5 ± 5.1 mcg/mL, respectively. The corresponding mean (±SD) C


max concentrations were 15.1 ± 6.1, 15.3 ± 7.6, and 16.8 ± 6.4 mcg/mL.


AbsorptionAtovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility. The mean (±SD) absolute bioavailability of atovaquone from a 750 mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension administered under fed conditions in 9 HIV-1–­infected (CD4 > 100 cells/mm


3) volunteers was 47% ± 15%.


Effect of Food: Administering atovaquone oral suspension with food enhances atovaquone bioavailability. Sixteen healthy subjects received a single 750 mg dose of atovaquone oral suspension after an overnight fast and following a meal (23 g fat: 610 kCal). The mean (±SD) atovaquone AUC under fasting and fed conditions were 324 ± 115 and 801 ± 320 h<U+25CF>mcg/mL, respectively, representing a 2.6 ± 1-fold increase.


DistributionFollowing IV administration of atovaquone, the mean (±SD) volume of distribution at steady state (Vd


ss) was 0.60 ± 0.17 L/kg (n = 9). Atovaquone is extensively bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. In 3 HIV-1–infected children who received 750 mg atovaquone as the tablet formulation 4 times daily for 2 weeks, the cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of atovaquone were 0.04, 0.14, and 0.26 mcg/mL, representing less than 1% of the plasma concentration.


EliminationThe mean (±SD) half-life of atovaquone was 62.5 ± 35.3 hours after IV administration and ranged from 67.0 ± 33.4 to 77.6 ± 23.1 hours following administration of atovaquone oral suspension.Metabolism: The metabolism of atovaquone is unknown.


Excretion: Following oral administration of 


14C-labelled atovaquone to healthy subjects, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days.


Specific PopulationsPatients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment: The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone have not been studied in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.


HIV-Infected Subjects: When atovaquone oral suspension was administered to 5 HIV-1–infected subjects at a dose of 750 mg twice daily, the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration was 21.0 ± 4.9 mcg/mL and mean (±SD) C


max was 24.0 ± 5.7 mcg/mL. The mean (±SD) minimum plasma atovaquone concentration (C


min) associated with the 750-mg twice-daily regimen was 16.7 ± 4.6 mcg/mL.


In an open-label PCP trial in 18 HIV-1–infected subjects, administration of atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg twice daily with meals resulted in a mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration of 22.0 ± 10.1 mcg/mL.The mean (± SD) plasma clearance of atovaquone following IV administration in 9 HIV-1–infected subjects was 10.4 ± 5.5 mL/min (0.15 ± 0.09 mL/min/kg).Drug Interaction StudiesRifampin/Rifabutin: In a trial with 13 HIV-1–infected volunteers, the oral administration of rifampin 600 mg every 24 hours with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg every 12 hours resulted in a 52% ± 13% decrease in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 37% ± 42% increase in the mean (±SD) steady-state plasma rifampin concentration. The half-life of atovaquone decreased from 82 ± 36 hours when administered without rifampin to 50 ± 16 hours with rifampin. In a trial of 24 healthy volunteers, the oral administration of rifabutin 300 mg once daily with atovaquone oral suspension 750 mg twice daily resulted in a 34% decrease in the mean steady-state plasma atovaquone concentration and a 19% decrease in the mean steady-state plasma rifabutin concentration.


Tetracycline: Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.


Metoclopramide: Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with a 50% reduction in steady-state atovaquone plasma concentrations.


Indinavir: Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and C


max of indinavir, but resulted in a decrease in the C


trough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI: 8%, 35%]).


Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX): Concomitant administration of atovaquone oral suspension 500 mg once daily (not the approved dosage) and TMP-SMX in 6 HIV-infected adult subjects did not result in significant changes in either atovaquone or TMP-SMX exposure.


Zidovudine: The administration of atovaquone tablets 750 mg every 12 hours with zidovudine 200 mg every 8 hours to 14 HIV-1 infected subjects resulted in a 24% ± 12% decrease in zidovudine apparent oral clearance, leading to a 35% ± 23% increase in plasma zidovudine AUC. The glucuronide metabolite: parent ratio decreased from a mean of 4.5 when zidovudine was administered alone to 3.1 when zidovudine was administered with atovaquone tablets. This effect is minor and would not be expected to produce clinically significant events. Zidovudine had no effect on atovaquone pharmacokinetics.


","PHARMACOKINETICS SECTION"
"798","212918","Mechanism of ActionAtovaquone is a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an analog of ubiquinone, with antipneumocystis activity. The mechanism of action against 


Pneumocystis jirovecii has not been fully elucidated. In 


Plasmodium species, the site of action appears to be the cytochrome 


bc
1 complex (Complex III). Several metabolic enzymes are linked to the mitochondrial electron transport chain via ubiquinone. Inhibition of electron transport by atovaquone results in indirect inhibition of these enzymes. The ultimate metabolic effects of such blockade may include inhibition of nucleic acid and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.

Use with caution for the treatment of malaria in patients with severe renal impairment, only if the benefits of the 3-day treatment regimen outweigh the potential risks associated with increased drug exposure. No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]
Absorption of atovaquone may be reduced in patients with diarrhea or vomiting. If atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets are used in patients who are vomiting, parasitemia should be closely monitored and the use of an antiemetic considered [see Dosage and Administration (2)]. Vomiting occurred in up to 19% of pediatric patients given treatment doses of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets. In the controlled clinical trials, 15.3% of adults received an antiemetic when they received atovaquone/proguanil and 98.3% of these patients were successfully treated. In patients with severe or persistent diarrhea or vomiting, alternative antimalarial therapy may be required.In mixed P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infections, P. vivax parasite relapse occurred commonly when patients were treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets alone.In the event of recrudescent P. falciparum infections after treatment with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets or failure of chemoprophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets, patients should be treated with a different blood schizonticide.Elevated liver laboratory tests and cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation have been reported with prophylactic use of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets.Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets have not been evaluated for the treatment of cerebral malaria or other severe manifestations of complicated malaria, including hyperparasitemia, pulmonary edema, or renal failure. Patients with severe malaria are not candidates for oral therapy.Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.Because atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets contain atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. The lower prophylactic doses of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets were better tolerated than the higher treatment doses.In 3 clinical trials (2 of which were placebo-controlled) 381 adults (mean age: 31 years) received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets for the prophylaxis of malaria; the majority of adults were black (90%) and 79% were male. In a clinical trial for the prophylaxis of malaria, 125 pediatric patients (mean age: 9 years) received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets; all subjects were black and 52% were male. Adverse experiences reported in adults and pediatric patients considered attributable to therapy occurred in similar proportions of subjects receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets or placebo in all studies. Prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets was discontinued prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse experience in 3 of 381 (0.8%) adults and 0 of 125 pediatric patients.In a placebo-controlled study of malaria prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets involving 330 pediatric patients (aged 4 to 14 years) in Gabon, a malaria-endemic area, the safety profile of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets was consistent with that observed in the earlier prophylactic studies in adults and pediatric patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets were abdominal pain (13%), headache (13%), and cough (10%). Abdominal pain (13% vs. 8%) and vomiting (5% vs. 3%) were reported more often with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets than with placebo. No patient withdrew from the study due to an adverse experience with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets. No routine laboratory data were obtained during this study.Non-immune travelers visiting a malaria-endemic area received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets (n = 1,004) for prophylaxis of malaria in 2 active-controlled clinical trials. In one study (n = 493), the mean age of subjects was 33 years and 53% were male; 90% of subjects were white, 6% of subjects were black, and the remaining were of other racial/ethnic groups. In the other study (n = 511), the mean age of subjects was 36 years and 51% were female; the majority of subjects (97%) were white. Adverse experiences occurred in a similar or lower proportion of subjects receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets than an active comparator (Table 3). Fewer neuropsychiatric adverse experiences occurred in subjects who received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets than mefloquine. Fewer gastrointestinal adverse experiences occurred in subjects receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets than chloroquine/proguanil. Compared with active comparator drugs, subjects receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets had fewer adverse experiences overall that were attributed to prophylactic therapy (Table 3). Prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets was discontinued prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse experience in 7 of 1,004 travelers.

The mean duration of exposure was 23 days for atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets, 46 days for chloroquine, and 43 days for proguanil, reflecting the different recommended dosage regimens for these products. Fewer patients treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets reported abdominal pain (2% vs. 7%) or nausea (< 1% vs. 7%) than children who received chloroquine/proguanil. Oral ulceration (2% vs. 2%), vivid dreams (2% vs. < 1%), and blurred vision (0% vs. 2%) occurred in similar proportions of patients receiving either atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets or chloroquine/proguanil, respectively. Two patients discontinued prophylaxis with chloroquine/proguanil due to adverse events, while none of those receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets discontinued due to adverse events.In 7 controlled trials, 436 adolescents and adults received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets for treatment of acute, uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The range of mean ages of subjects was 26 to 29 years; 79% of subjects were male. In these studies, 48% of subjects were classified as other racial/ethnic groups, primarily Asian; 42% of subjects were black and the remaining subjects were white. Attributable adverse experiences that occurred in = 5% of patients were abdominal pain (17%), nausea (12%), vomiting (12%), headache (10%), diarrhea (8%), asthenia (8%), anorexia (5%), and dizziness (5%). Treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience in 4 of 436 (0.9%) adolescents and adults treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets.In 2 controlled trials, 116 pediatric patients (weighing 11 to 40 kg) (mean age: 7 years) received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets for the treatment of malaria. The majority of subjects were black (72%); 28% were of other racial/ethnic groups, primarily Asian. Attributable adverse experiences that occurred in = 5% of patients were vomiting (10%) and pruritus (6%). Vomiting occurred in 43 of 319 (13%) pediatric patients who did not have symptomatic malaria but were given treatment doses of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets for 3 days in a clinical trial. The design of this clinical trial required that any patient who vomited be withdrawn from the trial. Among pediatric patients with symptomatic malaria treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets, treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience in 1 of 116 (0.9%).In a study of 100 pediatric patients (5 to < 11 kg body weight) who received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, only diarrhea (6%) occurred in = 5% of patients as an adverse experience attributable to atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets. In 3 patients (3%), treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience.Abnormalities in laboratory tests reported in clinical trials were limited to elevations of transaminases in patients with malaria being treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets. The frequency of these abnormalities varied substantially across trials of treatment and were not observed in the randomized portions of the prophylaxis trials.One active-controlled trial evaluated the treatment of malaria in Thai adults (n = 182); the mean age of subjects was 26 years (range: 15 to 63 years); 80% of subjects were male. Early elevations of ALT and AST occurred more frequently in patients treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets (n = 91) compared with patients treated with an active control, mefloquine (n = 91). On Day 7, rates of elevated ALT and AST with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets and mefloquine (for patients who had normal baseline levels of these clinical laboratory parameters) were ALT 26.7% vs. 15.6%; AST 16.9% vs. 8.6%, respectively. By Day 14 of this 28-day study, the frequency of transaminase elevations equalized across the 2 groups. In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets. Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection to atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets.Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: Neutropenia and anemia. Pancytopenia in patients with severe renal impairment treated with proguanil [see Contraindications (4)].Immune System Disorders: Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and vasculitis.Nervous System Disorders: Seizures and psychotic events (such as hallucinations); however, a causal relationship has not been established.Gastrointestinal Disorders: Stomatitis.Hepatobiliary Disorders: Elevated liver laboratory tests, hepatitis, cholestasis; hepatic failure requiring transplant has been reported.Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: Photosensitivity, rash, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The concomitant administration of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets and rifampin or rifabutin is not recommended.Proguanil may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarin-based anticoagulants. The mechanism of this potential drug interaction has not been established. Caution is advised when initiating or withdrawing malaria prophylaxis or treatment with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets in patients on continuous treatment with coumarin-based anticoagulants. When these products are administered concomitantly, coagulation tests should be closely monitored.Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with a reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Parasitemia should be closely monitored in patients receiving tetracycline.While antiemetics may be indicated for patients receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets, metoclopramide may reduce the bioavailability of atovaquone and should be used only if other antiemetics are not available [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Concomitant administration of atovaquone and indinavir did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Caution should be exercised when prescribing atovaquone with indinavir due to the decrease in trough concentrations of indinavir.NAMalaria during pregnancy increases the risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal anemia, prematurity, spontaneous abortion, and stillbirth.NANAAtovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (Gestation Day [GD] 6 to GD15) in pregnant rats did not cause maternal or embryo-fetal toxicity at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to maternal plasma exposures up to 7.3 times the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC. In pregnant rabbits, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 300, 600, and 1,200 mg/kg/day by gavage during organogenesis (GD6 to GD18) was associated with decreased fetal body length at a maternally toxic dose of 1,200 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures that were approximately 1.3 times the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria based on AUC. In a pre- and post-natal study in rats, atovaquone administered in oral doses of 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg/day from GD15 until Lactation Day (LD) 20 did not impair the growth or developmental effects in first generation offspring at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to AUC exposures of approximately 7.3 times the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria. Atovaquone crossed the placenta and was present in fetal rat and rabbit tissue.Proguanil administered orally to pregnant rats during organogenesis (GD6 to GD17) was not associated with fetal malformations, but increased ureter variations at a maternally toxic dose of 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to a plasma concentration approximately equal to 0.07 times the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC. Proguanil given orally by gavage at a maternally toxic dose of 40 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (GD6 to GD20) did not produce adverse embryo-fetal effects at a plasma concentration up to 0.8 times the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC. In a pre- and post-natal study in female rats, proguanil hydrochloride administered in oral doses of 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day from GD6 until LD20 did not impair the growth, development, or reproductive ability of first generation offspring or the survivability of second generation offspring at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (0.04 times the average human exposure based on AUC). Pre- and post-natal studies of proguanil in animals at exposures similar to or greater than those observed in humans have not been conducted.The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride administered orally to pregnant rats in atovaquone:proguanil hydrochloride doses of 12.5:5, 25:10, and 50:20 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD17) did not produce maternal toxicity or adverse embryo-fetal developmental effects with doses up to 50:20 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma concentrations up to 1.7 and 0.1 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria based on AUC. In pregnant rabbits, the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride administered orally in atovaquone:proguanil hydrochloride doses of 25:10, 50:20, or 100:40 mg/kg/day during organogenesis (GD6 to GD20) did not produce adverse embryo-fetal developmental effects at a maternally toxic dose of 100:40 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma concentrations of approximately 0.3 and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria based on AUC.In a rat study with doses of 10 and 250 mg/kg, given orally by gavage on postpartum Day 11, atovaquone concentrations in the milk were 30% of the concurrent atovaquone concentrations in the maternal plasma at both doses. The concentration of drug in animal milk does not necessarily predict the concentration of drug in human milk.Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients who weigh less than 11 kg. The efficacy and safety of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets have been established for the prophylaxis of malaria in controlled trials involving pediatric patients weighing 11 kg or more [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients who weigh less than 5 kg. The efficacy and safety of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets for the treatment of malaria have been established in controlled trials involving pediatric patients weighing 5 kg or more [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Do not use atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets for malaria prophylaxis in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). Use with caution for the treatment of malaria in patients with severe renal impairment only if the benefits of the 3-day treatment regimen outweigh the potential risks associated with increased drug exposure. No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No trials have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment. The effect of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets on the QT interval is unknown in humans.Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility. The bioavailability of atovaquone shows considerable inter-individual variability.Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets should be taken with food or a milky drink. Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and Cmax 5 times over fasting. The absolute bioavailability of the tablet formulation of atovaquone when taken with food is 23%.Atovaquone is highly protein bound (> 99%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. A population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the apparent volume of distribution of atovaquone (V/F) in adult and pediatric patients after oral administration is approximately 8.8 L/kg.Proguanil is 75% protein bound. A population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the apparent V/F of proguanil in adult and pediatric patients older than 15 years with body weights from 31 to 110 kg ranged from 1,617 to 2,502 L. In pediatric patients 15 years and younger with body weights from 11 to 56 kg, the V/F of proguanil ranged from 462 to 966 L.In human plasma, the binding of atovaquone and proguanil was unaffected by the presence of the other.The elimination half-life of atovaquone is about 2 to 3 days in adult patients. The elimination half-life of proguanil is 12 to 21 hours in both adult patients and pediatric patients, but may be longer in individuals who are slow metabolizers.The main routes of elimination are hepatic biotransformation and renal excretion. In a study where 14C-labeled atovaquone was administered to healthy volunteers, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days. There was little or no excretion of atovaquone in the urine (less than 0.6%). There is indirect evidence that atovaquone may undergo limited metabolism; however, a specific metabolite has not been identified. Between 40% to 60% of proguanil is excreted by the kidneys. Proguanil is metabolized to cycloguanil (primarily via cytochrome P450 2C19 [CYP2C19] and 4-chlorophenylbiguanide.A population pharmacokinetic analysis in adult and pediatric patients showed that the apparent clearance (CL/F) of both atovaquone and proguanil is related to body weight. The values CL/F for both atovaquone and proguanil in subjects with body weight = 11 kg are shown in Table 4.Table 4.

However, the elimination half-life of atovaquone is shorter in pediatric patients (1 to 2 days) than in adult patients (2 to 3 days). In clinical trials, plasma trough concentrations of atovaquone and proguanil in pediatric patients weighing 5 to 40 kg were within the range observed in adults after dosing by body weight.In a single-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil were compared in 13 elderly subjects (aged 65 to 79 years) with those of 13 younger subjects (aged 30 to 45 years). In the elderly subjects, the extent of systemic exposure (AUC) of cycloguanil was increased (point estimate: 2.36, 90% CI: 1.70, 3.28). Tmax was longer in elderly subjects (median 8 hours) compared with younger subjects (median: 4 hours) and average elimination half-life was longer in elderly subjects (mean: 14.9 hours) compared with younger subjects (mean: 8.3 hours).In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min), oral clearance and/or AUC data for atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil are within the range of values observed in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min), mean oral clearance for proguanil was reduced by approximately 35% compared with patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 mL/min) and the oral clearance of atovaquone was comparable between patients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment. No data exist on the use of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets for long-term prophylaxis (over 2 months) in individuals with moderate renal failure. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min), atovaquone Cmax and AUC are reduced but the elimination half-lives for proguanil and cycloguanil are prolonged, with corresponding increases in AUC, resulting in the potential of drug accumulation and toxicity with repeated dosing [see Contraindications (4)].In a single-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil were compared in 13 subjects with hepatic impairment (9 mild, 4 moderate, as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) with those of 13 subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment as compared with healthy subjects, there were no marked differences (< 50%) in the rate or extent of systemic exposure of atovaquone. However, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the elimination half-life of atovaquone was increased (point estimate: 1.28, 90% CI: 1.00 to 1.63). Proguanil AUC, Cmax, and its elimination half-life increased in subjects with mild hepatic impairment when compared with healthy subjects (Table 5). Also, the proguanil AUC and its elimination half-life increased in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment when compared with healthy subjects. Consistent with the increase in proguanil AUC, there were marked decreases in the systemic exposure of cycloguanil (Cmax and AUC) and an increase in its elimination half-life in subjects with mild hepatic impairment when compared with healthy volunteers (Table 5). There were few measurable cycloguanil concentrations in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil after administration of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.Table 5.

Potential pharmacokinetic interactions between proguanil or cycloguanil and other drugs that are CYP2C19 substrates or inhibitors are unknown.Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively. The mechanisms of these interactions are unknown.Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with approximately a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone.Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with decreased bioavailability of atovaquone.Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg twice daily with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg three times daily without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and Cmax of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the Ctrough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI: 8%, 35%]).NAThe constituents of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride, interfere with 2 different pathways involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines required for nucleic acid replication. Atovaquone is a selective inhibitor of parasite mitochondrial electron transport. Proguanil hydrochloride primarily exerts its effect by means of the metabolite cycloguanil, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor. Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase in the Plasmodium parasite disrupts deoxythymidylate synthesis. Atovaquone and cycloguanil (an active metabolite of proguanil) are active against the erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum. Enhanced efficacy of the combination compared with either atovaquone or proguanil hydrochloride alone was demonstrated in clinical trials in both immune and non-immune patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)].Strains of P. falciparum with decreased susceptibility to atovaquone or proguanil/cycloguanil alone can be selected in vitro or in vivo. The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride may not be effective for treatment of recrudescent malaria that develops after prior therapy with the combination.A 24-month carcinogenicity study in CD rats was negative for neoplasms at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 54 times the average steady-state plasma concentrations in humans during prophylaxis of malaria. In CD-1 mice, a 24-month study showed treatment-related increases in incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma at all doses tested (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day) which correlated with at least 15 times the average steady-state plasma concentrations in humans during prophylaxis of malaria.Atovaquone was negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay, the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay, and the cultured human lymphocyte cytogenetic assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.Atovaquone administered by oral gavage in doses of 100, 300, or 1,000 mg/kg/day to adult male rats from 73 days prior to mating until 20 days after mating and to adult female rats from 14 days prior to mating until LD20 did not impair male or female fertility or early embryonic development at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures of approximately 7.3 times the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC.No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was observed in 24-month studies conducted in CD-1 mice at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.5 times the average human plasma exposure during prophylaxis of malaria based on AUC, and in Wistar Hannover rats at doses up 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.1 times the average human plasma exposure during prophylaxis of malaria based on AUC.Proguanil was negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay and the mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.Cycloguanil, the active metabolite of proguanil, was also negative in the Ames test, but was positive in the mouse lymphoma assay and the mouse micronucleus assay. These positive effects with cycloguanil, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, were significantly reduced or abolished with folinic acid supplementation.Proguanil administered orally in doses of 4, 8, and 16 mg/kg/day to male rats from 29 days prior to mating until 27 days after mating and to females from 15 days prior to mating through GD7 revealed no adverse effects on adult male or female fertility or early embryonic development at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day (up to 0.04 times the average human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC). Fertility studies of proguanil in animals at exposures similar to or greater than those observed in humans have not been conducted. Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets were evaluated for prophylaxis of P. falciparum malaria in 5 clinical trials in malaria-endemic areas and in 3 active-controlled trials in non-immune travelers to malaria-endemic areas.Three placebo-controlled trials of 10 to 12 weeks’ duration were conducted among residents of malaria-endemic areas in Kenya, Zambia, and Gabon. The mean age of subjects was 30 (range: 17 to 55), 32 (range: 16 to 64), and 10 (range: 5 to 16) years, respectively. Of a total of 669 randomized patients (including 264 pediatric patients aged 5 to 16 years), 103 were withdrawn for reasons other than falciparum malaria- or drug-related adverse events (55% of these were lost to follow-up and 45% were withdrawn for protocol violations). The results are listed in Table 6.Table 6. Prevention of ParasitemiaFree of parasitemia during the 10- to 12-week period of prophylactic therapy. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials of Atovaquone and Proguanil Hydrochloride Tablets for Prophylaxis of P. falciparum Malaria in Residents of Malaria-Endemic AreasAtovaquone and Proguanil Hydrochloride TabletsPlaceboTotal number of patients randomized326343Failed to complete study5746Developed parasitemia (P. falciparum)292In another study, 330 Gabonese pediatric patients (weighing 13 to 40 kg and aged 4 to 14 years) who had received successful open-label radical cure treatment with artesunate, were randomized to receive either atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets (dosage based on body weight) or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. Blood smears were obtained weekly and any time malaria was suspected. Nineteen of the 165 children given atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets and 18 of 165 patients given placebo withdrew from the study for reasons other than parasitemia (primary reason was lost to follow-up). One out of 150 evaluable patients (< 1%) who received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets developed P. falciparum parasitemia while receiving prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets compared with 31 (22%) of the 144 evaluable placebo recipients.In a 10-week study in 175 South African subjects who moved into malaria-endemic areas and were given prophylaxis with 1 atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablet daily, parasitemia developed in 1 subject who missed several doses of medication. Since no placebo control was included, the incidence of malaria in this study was not known.Two active-controlled trials were conducted in non-immune travelers who visited a malaria-endemic area. The mean duration of travel was 18 days (range: 2 to 38 days). Of a total of 1,998 randomized patients who received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets or controlled drug, 24 discontinued from the study before follow-up evaluation 60 days after leaving the endemic area. Nine of these were lost to follow-up, 2 withdrew because of an adverse experience, and 13 were discontinued for other reasons. These trials were not large enough to allow for statements of comparative efficacy. In addition, the true exposure rate to P. falciparum malaria in both trials is unknown. The results are listed in Table 7.Table 7. Prevention of ParasitemiaFree of parasitemia during the period of prophylactic therapy. in Active-Controlled Clinical Trials of Atovaquone and Proguanil Hydrochloride Tablets for Prophylaxis of P. falciparum Malaria in Non-Immune TravelersAtovaquoneand ProguanilHydrochloride TabletsMefloquineChloroquine plus ProguanilTotal number of randomized patients who received study drug1,004483511Failed to complete study1464Developed parasitemia (P. falciparum)003A third randomized, open-label study was conducted which included 221 otherwise healthy pediatric patients (weighing = 11 kg and aged 2 to 17 years) who were at risk of contracting malaria by traveling to an endemic area. The mean duration of travel was 15 days (range: 1 to 30 days). Prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets (n = 110, dosage based on body weight) began 1 or 2 days before entering the endemic area and lasted until 7 days after leaving the area. A control group (n = 111) received prophylaxis with chloroquine/proguanil dosed according to WHO guidelines. No cases of malaria occurred in either group of children. However, the study was not large enough to allow for statements of comparative efficacy. In addition, the true exposure rate to P. falciparum malaria in this study is unknown.In separate trials with small numbers of volunteers, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride were independently shown to have causal prophylactic activity directed against liver-stage parasites of P. falciparum. Six patients given a single dose of atovaquone 250 mg 24 hours prior to malaria challenge were protected from developing malaria, whereas all 4 placebo-treated patients developed malaria.During the 4 weeks following cessation of prophylaxis in clinical trial participants who remained in malaria-endemic areas and were available for evaluation, malaria developed in 24 of 211 (11.4%) subjects who took placebo and 9 of 328 (2.7%) who took atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets. While new infections could not be distinguished from recrudescent infections, all but 1 of the infections in patients treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets occurred more than 15 days after stopping therapy. The single case occurring on Day 8 following cessation of therapy with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets probably represents a failure of prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets.The possibility that delayed cases of P. falciparum malaria may occur sometime after stopping prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets cannot be ruled out. Hence, returning travelers developing febrile illnesses should be investigated for malaria. In 3 Phase 2 clinical trials, atovaquone alone, proguanil hydrochloride alone, and the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride were evaluated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum. Among 156 evaluable patients, the parasitological cure rate (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) was 59/89 (66%) with atovaquone alone, 1/17 (6%) with proguanil hydrochloride alone, and 50/50 (100%) with the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride.Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets were evaluated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by P. falciparum in 8 Phase 3 randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials (N = 1,030 enrolled in both treatment groups). The mean age of subjects was 27 years and 16% were children 12 years and younger; 74% of subjects were male. Evaluable patients included those whose outcomes at 28 days were known. Among 471 evaluable patients treated with the equivalent of 4 atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets once daily for 3 days, 464 had a sensitive response (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) (Table 8). Seven patients had a response of RI resistance (elimination of parasitemia but with recurrent parasitemia between 7 and 28 days after starting treatment). In these trials, the response to treatment with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets was similar to treatment with the comparator drug in 4 trials.Table 8.

Of the 23 patients in Thailand infected with P. vivax and treated with atovaquone/proguanil hydrochloride 1,000 mg/400 mg daily for 3 days, parasitemia cleared in 21 (91.3%) at 7 days. Parasite relapse occurred commonly when P. vivax malaria was treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets alone. Relapsing malarias including P. vivax and P. ovale require additional treatment to prevent relapse.The efficacy of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets in treating acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in children weighing = 5 and < 11 kg was examined in an open-label, randomized trial conducted in Gabon. Patients received either atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets (2 or 3 atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride pediatric tablets once daily depending upon body weight) for 3 days (n = 100) or amodiaquine (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 days (n = 100). In this study, the atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets were crushed and mixed with condensed milk just prior to administration. An adequate clinical response (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) was obtained in 95% (87/92) of the evaluable pediatric patients who received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets and in 53% (41/78) of those evaluable who received amodiaquine. A response of RI resistance (elimination of parasitemia but with recurrent parasitemia between 7 and 28 days after starting treatment) was noted in 3% and 40% of the patients, respectively. Two cases of RIII resistance (rising parasite count despite therapy) were reported in the patients receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets. There were 4 cases of RIII in the amodiaquine arm. ","SPL UNCLASSIFIED SECTION"

"830","202362","Available data from published literature and postmarketing experience with use of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets in pregnant women are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk for major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The proguanil component of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets acts to inhibit parasitic dihydrofolate reductase; however, pregnant women and females of reproductive potential should continue folate supplementation to prevent neural tube defects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4)]. Pregnant women with malaria are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (see Clinical Considerations).Atovaquone administered by oral gavage to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not associated with fetal malformations at plasma exposures approximately 7 times and equal to, respectively, the estimated human exposure for the treatment of malaria based on AUC. Proguanil administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis was not associated with embryo-fetal toxicity at maternally toxic plasma exposures approximately 0.07 and 0.8 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure for treatment of malaria based on AUC (see Data).The combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride given orally by gavage during the period of organogenesis was not associated with embryo-fetal developmental effects in pregnant rats or rabbits at atovaquone:proguanil hydrochloride doses of 50:20 mg/kg/day and 100:40 mg/kg/day, respectively (1.7 and 0.1 times and 0.3 and 0.5 times, respectively, the estimated human exposure for treatment of malaria). In a pre- and post-natal study with atovaquone and another pre- and post-natal study with proguanil, neither compound impaired the growth, development, or reproductive ability of first generation offspring at maternal AUC exposures of approximately 7.3 and 0.04 times, respectively, the estimated human AUC exposure for treatment of malaria (see Data).The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.There are no data on the presence of atovaquone in human milk; however, proguanil is present in human milk. Atovaquone is present in rat milk (see Data). When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely the drug will be present in human milk. There are no data on the effects of atovaquone and proguanil on the breastfed child or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets and any potential adverse effect on the breastfed child from atovaquone and proguanil or from the underlying maternal condition.","RISKS"
"842","202362","Clinical trials of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

Each scored tablet contains 25 mg pyrimethamine and the inactive ingredients corn starch, lactose monohydrate, and magnesium stearate. Pyrimethamine, known chemically as 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-6-ethyl-2, 4-pyrimidinediamine, has the following structural formula: C12H13ClN4
Mol. Wt. 248.71","DESCRIPTION SECTION"
"881","211271","Pyrimethamine is well absorbed with peak levels occurring between 2 to 6 hours following administration. It is eliminated slowly and has a plasma half-life of approximately 96 hours. Pyrimethamine is 87% bound to human plasma proteins.
Microbiology: Pyrimethamine is a folic acid antagonist and the rationale for its therapeutic action is based on the differential requirement between host and parasite for nucleic acid precursors involved in growth. This activity is highly selective against Toxoplasma gondii.
The action of pyrimethamine against Toxoplasma gondii is greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with sulfonamides. This was demonstrated by Eyles and Coleman1 in the treatment of experimental toxoplasmosis in the mouse. Jacobs et al2 demonstrated that combination of the 2 drugs effectively prevented the development of severe uveitis in most rabbits following the inoculation of the anterior chamber of the eye with toxoplasma.
","CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION"
"882","211271","Treatment of Toxoplasmosis: Pyrimethamine is indicated for the treatment of toxoplasmosis when used conjointly with a sulfonamide, since synergism exists with this combination.
","INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION"
"883","211271","Use of pyrimethamine is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to pyrimethamine or to any component of the formulation. Use of the drug is also contraindicated in patients with documented megaloblastic anemia due to folate deficiency.
","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"884","211271","The dosage of pyrimethamine required for the treatment of toxoplasmosis has a narrow therapeutic window. If signs of folate deficiency develop (see ADVERSE REACTIONS), reduce the dosage or discontinue the drug according to the response of the patient. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered in a dosage of 5 to 15 mg daily (orally, IV, or IM) until normal hematopoiesis is restored. Data in 2 humans indicate that pyrimethamine may be carcinogenic; a 51-year-old female who developed chronic granulocytic leukemia after taking pyrimethamine for 2 years for toxoplasmosis3 and a 56-year-old patient who developed reticulum cell sarcoma after 14 months of pyrimethamine for toxoplasmosis.4
Pyrimethamine has been reported to produce a significant increase in the number of lung tumors in mice when given intraperitoneally at doses of 25 mg/kg.5
Pyrimethamine should be kept out of the reach of infants and children as they are extremely susceptible to adverse effects from an overdose. Deaths in pediatric patients have been reported after accidental ingestion.
","WARNINGS SECTION"
"885","211271","General: A small ""starting"" dose for toxoplasmosis is recommended in patients with convulsive disorders to avoid the potential nervous system toxicity of pyrimethamine. Pyrimethamine should be used with caution in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function or in patients with possible folate deficiency, such as individuals with malabsorption syndrome, alcoholism, or pregnancy, and those receiving therapy, such as phenytoin, affecting folate levels (see Pregnancy subsection).
","GENERAL PRECAUTIONS SECTION"
"886","211271","Information for Patients: Patients should be warned that at the first appearance of a skin rash they should stop use of pyrimethamine and seek medical attention immediately. Patients should also be warned that the appearance of sore throat, pallor, purpura, or glossitis may be early indications of serious disorders which require treatment with pyrimethamine to be stopped and medical treatment to be sought. Women of childbearing potential who are taking pyrimethamine should be warned against becoming pregnant. Patients should be warned to keep pyrimethamine out of the reach of children. Patients should be advised not to exceed recommended doses. Patients should be warned that if anorexia and vomiting occur, they may be minimized by taking the drug with meals. Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended when used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis in all patients.
","INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS SECTION"
"887","211271","Laboratory Tests: In patients receiving high dosage, semiweekly blood counts, including platelet counts, should be performed.
","LABORATORY TESTS SECTION"
"888","211271","Drug Interactions: Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine and other antimalarials, and with other antibiotics. However, the concomitant use of other antifolic drugs or agents associated with myelosuppression including sulfonamides or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combinations, proguanil, zidovudine, or cytostatic agents (e.g., methotrexate), while the patient is receiving pyrimethamine, may increase the risk of bone marrow suppression. If signs of folate deficiency develop, pyrimethamine should be discontinued. Folinic acid (leucovorin) should be administered until normal hematopoiesis is restored (see WARNINGS). Mild hepatotoxicity has been reported in some patients when lorazepam and pyrimethamine were administered concomitantly.

Pyrimethamine has also been shown to produce terata such as meningocele in hamsters and cleft palate in miniature pigs when given in oral doses 5 times the human dose for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Pyrimethamine should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended when used during pregnancy.

Consult the complete prescribing information for the relevant sulfonamide for sulfonamide-associated adverse events. With doses of pyrimethamine used for the treatment of toxoplasmosis, anorexia and vomiting may occur. Vomiting may be minimized by giving the medication with meals; it usually disappears promptly upon reduction of dosage. Doses used in toxoplasmosis may produce megaloblastic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, neutropenia, atrophic glossitis, hematuria, and disorders of cardiac rhythm. Hematologic effects, however, may also occur at low doses in certain individuals (see PRECAUTIONS; General). Pulmonary eosinophilia has been reported rarely. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alvogen, Inc. at 1-866-770-3024 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.","ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION"
"896","211271","Following the ingestion of 300 mg or more of pyrimethamine, gastrointestinal and/or central nervous system signs may be present, including convulsions. The initial symptoms are usually gastrointestinal and may include abdominal pain, nausea, severe and repeated vomiting, possibly including hematemesis. Central nervous system toxicity may be manifest by initial excitability, generalized and prolonged convulsions which may be followed by respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, and death within a few hours. Neurological symptoms appear rapidly (30 minutes to 2 hours after drug ingestion), suggesting that in gross overdosage pyrimethamine has a direct toxic effect on the central nervous system.
The fatal dose is variable, with the smallest reported fatal single dose being 375 mg. There are, however, reports of pediatric patients who have recovered after taking 375 to 625 mg.
There is no specific antidote to acute pyrimethamine poisoning.In the event of overdosage, symptomatic and supportive measures should be employed. Gastric lavage is recommended and is effective if carried out very soon after drug ingestion. Parenteral diazepam may be used to control convulsions. Folinic acid should be administered within 2 hours of drug ingestion to be most effective in counteracting the effects on the hematopoietic system (see WARNINGS). Due to the long half-life of pyrimethamine, daily monitoring of peripheral blood counts is recommended for up to several weeks after the overdose until normal hematologic values are restored.
","OVERDOSAGE SECTION"
"897","211271","For Treatment of Toxoplasmosis: The dosage of pyrimethamine for the treatment of toxoplasmosis must be carefully adjusted so as to provide maximum therapeutic effect and a minimum of side effects.At the dosage required, there is a marked variation in the tolerance to the drug. Young patients may tolerate higher doses than older individuals. Concurrent administration of folinic acid is strongly recommended in all patients.
The adult starting dose is 50 to 75 mg of the drug daily, together with 1 to 4 gdaily of a sulfonamide of the sulfapyrimidine type, e.g. sulfadoxine. This dosage is ordinarily continued for 1 to 3 weeks, depending on the response of the patient and tolerance to therapy. The dosage may then be reduced to about one half that previously given for each drug and continued for an additional 4 to 5 weeks. The pediatric dosage of pyrimethamine is 1 mg/kg/day divided into 2 equal daily doses; after 2 to 4 days this dose may be reduced to one half and continued for approximately 1 month.

"903","210959","Pharmacokinetics: Following a single 200 mg oral dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to healthy males, the mean peak blood concentration of hydroxychloroquine was 129.6 ng/mL, reached in 3.26 hours with a half-life of 537 hours (22.4 days). In the same study, the plasma peak concentration was 50.3 ng/mL reached in 3.74 hours with a half-life of 2963 hours (123.5 days). Urine hydroxychloroquine levels were still detectable after 3 months with approximately 10% of the dose excreted as the parent drug. Results following a single dose of a 200 mg tablet versus i.v. infusion (155 mg), demonstrated a half-life of about 40 days and a large volume of distribution. Peak blood concentrations of metabolites were observed at the same time as peak levels of hydroxychloroquine. The mean fraction of the dose absorbed was 0.74. After administration of single 155 mg and 310 mg intravenous doses, peak blood concentrations ranged from 1161 ng/mL to 2436 ng/mL (mean 1918 ng/mL) following the 155 mg infusion and 6 months following the 310 mg infusion. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different over the therapeutic dose range of 155 mg and 310 mg indicating linear kinetics.
Following chronic oral administration of hydroxychloroquine, significant levels of three metabolites, desethylhydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), desethylchloroquine (DCQ), and bidesethylhydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) have been found in plasma and blood, with DHCQ being the major metabolite. The absorption half-life was approximately 3 to 4 hours and the terminal half-life ranged from 40 to 50 days. The long half-life can be attributed to extensive tissue uptake rather than through decreased excretion. Peak plasma levels of hydroxychloroquine were seen in about 3 to 4 hours. Renal clearance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate for at least six months seemed to be similar to that of the single dose studies in volunteers, suggesting that no change occurs with chronic dosing. Range for renal clearance of unchanged drug was approximately 16 to 30% and did not correlate with creatinine clearance; therefore, a dosage adjustment is not required for patients with renal impairment. In RA patients, there was large variability as to the fraction of the dose absorbed (i.e. 30 to 100%), and mean hydroxychloroquine levels were significantly higher in patients with less disease activity. Cellular levels of patients on daily hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be higher in mononuclear cells than polymorphonuclear leucocytes.

Microbiology – Malaria
 
Mechanism of action: The precise mechanism by which hydroxychloroquine exhibits activity against Plasmodium is not known. Hydroxychloroquine, like chloroquine, is a weak base and may exert its effect by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA.


Activity in vitro and in Clinical Infections: Hydroxychloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of chloroquine sensitive strains of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium vivax. Hydroxychloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite stage (P. vivax and P. ovale) of the Plasmodium parasites.


Drug Resistance:  P. falciparum strains exhibiting reduced susceptibility to chloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine.

Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE – Malaria).
Patients in whom chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia, or patients who acquired malaria in a geographic area where chloroquine resistance is known to occur should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE – Malaria and WARNINGS).

Limitations of Use in Malaria
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for the treatment of complicated malaria.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not effective against chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium species (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology
). Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for the treatment of malaria acquired in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs or when the Plasmodium species has not been identified.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in geographic areas where chloroquine resistance occurs.Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets do not prevent relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale because it is not active against the hypnozoite forms of these parasites. For radical cure of P. vivax and P. ovale infections, concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology). Prior to prescribing hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for the treatment or prophylaxis of malaria, consult the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Malaria website (http://www.cdc.gov/malaria).

"905","210959","Use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-­aminoquinoline compounds.","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"906","210959","Resistant strains of malaria: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate is not effective against chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY – Microbiology).
Ocular: Irreversible retinal damage has been observed in some patients who had received hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Significant risk factors for retinal damage include daily doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 6.5 mg/kg (5 mg/kg base) of actual body weight, durations of use greater than five years, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of some concomitant drug products such as tamoxifen citrate and concurrent macular disease.
A baseline ocular examination is recommended within the first year of starting hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The baseline exam should include: best corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA), an automated threshold visual field (VF) of the central 10 degrees (with retesting if an abnormality is noted), and spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT).
For individuals with significant risk factors (daily dose of hydroxychloroquine sulfate greater than 5 mg/kg base of actual body weight, subnormal glomerular filtration, use of tamoxifen citrate or concurrent macular disease) monitoring should include annual examinations which include BCVA, VF and SD-OCT. For individuals without significant risk factors, annual exams can usually be deferred until five years of treatment.
In individuals of Asian descent, retinal toxicity may first be noticed outside the macula. In patients of Asian descent, it is recommended that visual field testing be performed in the central 24 degrees instead of the central 10 degrees.
It is recommended that hydroxychloroquine be discontinued if ocular toxicity is suspected and the patient should be closely observed given that retinal changes (and visual disturbances) may progress even after cessation of therapy.

Cardiac Effects, including Cardiomyopathy and QT prolongation: Postmarketing cases of life-threatening and fatal cardiomyopathy have been reported with use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate as well as with use of chloroquine. Patients may present with atrioventricular block, pulmonary hypertension, sick sinus syndrome or with cardiac complications. ECG findings may include atrioventricular, right or left bundle branch block. Signs or symptoms of cardiac compromise have appeared during acute and chronic treatment. Clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of cardiomyopathy is advised, including use of appropriate diagnostic tools such as ECG to monitor patients for cardiomyopathy during hydroxychloroquine sulfate therapy. Chronic toxicity should be considered when conduction disorders (bundle branch block/atrio-ventricular heart block) or biventricular hypertrophy are diagnosed. If cardiotoxicity is suspected, prompt discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate may prevent life-threatening complications.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate prolongs the QT interval. Ventricular arrhythmias and torsades de pointes have been reported in patients taking hydroxychloroquine sulfate (see OVERDOSAGE). Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval (see  DRUG INTERACTIONS ).

Worsening of psoriasis and porphyria: Use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in patients with psoriasis may precipitate a severe attack of psoriasis. When used in patients with porphyria the condition may be exacerbated. The preparation should not be used in these conditions unless in the judgment of the physician the benefit to the patient outweighs the possible hazard.

Proximal Myopathy and Neuropathy: Skeletal muscle myopathy or neuropathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depressed tendon reflexes, and abnormal nerve conduction, have been reported. Muscle and nerve biopsies have been associated with curvilinear bodies and muscle fiber atrophy with vacuolar changes. Assess muscle strength and deep tendon reflexes periodically in patients on long-term therapy with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.

Neuropsychiatric events, including suicidality: Suicidal behavior has been rarely reported in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.
Hypoglycemia: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate has been shown to cause severe hypoglycemia including loss of consciousness that could be life threatening in patients treated with or without antidiabetic medications (see DRUG INTERACTIONS and  ADVERSE REACTIONS
). Patients treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be warned about the risk of hypoglycemia and the associated clinical signs and symptoms. Patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia during treatment with hydroxychloroquine sulfate should have their blood glucose checked and treatment reviewed as necessary.","WARNINGS SECTION"
"907","210959","General:  Use with caution in patients with gastrointestinal, neurological, or blood disorders, and in those with a sensitivity to quinine. 


Hepatic/Renal Disease: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. A reduction in dosage may be necessary in patients with hepatic or renal disease, as well as in those taking medicines known to affect these organs.

Hematologic Effects/Laboratory Tests: Antimalarial compounds should be used with caution in patients with hepatic disease or alcoholism or in conjunction with known hepatotoxic drugs. Periodic blood cell counts should be performed if patients are given prolonged therapy. If any severe blood disorder such as aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, appears which is not attributable to the disease under treatment, consider discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine sulfate.
Hydroxychloroquine sulfate should be administered with caution in patients having glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PD) deficiency.

Dermatologic Effects: Dermatologic reactions to hydroxychloroquine sulfate may occur and, therefore, proper care should be exercised when it is administered to any patient receiving a drug with a significant tendency to produce dermatitis.

Drug Interactions


Digoxin: Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels: serum digoxin levels should be closely monitored in patients receiving combined therapy. 

Insulin or antidiabetic drugs: As hydroxychloroquine sulfate may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses of insulin or antidiabetic drugs may be required.  

Drugs that prolong QT interval and other arrhythmogenic drugs: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate prolongs the QT interval and should not be administered with other drugs that have the potential to induce cardiac arrhythmias. Also, there may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs.  

Mefloquine and other drugs known to lower the convulsive threshold: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate can lower the convulsive threshold. Co-administration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate with other antimalarials known to lower the convulsion threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of convulsions.  

Antiepileptics: The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if co-administered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate.  

Methotrexate: Combined use of methotrexate with hydroxychloroquine sulfate has not been studied and may increase the incidence of adverse effects.  

Cyclosporin: An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate were co-administered.

The following interactions have been observed on treatment with the structurally related substance chloroquine phosphate, and therefore cannot be ruled out for hydroxychloroquine. 


Praziquantel: Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel.  

Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed.  

Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided.  

Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin.

Information for Patients: Patients should be informed of the early signs and symptoms of toxicity such as rash or visual changes. Patients must see their physicians promptly in case of the appearance of these or of any unusual effects. Periodic laboratory tests may be recommended in some patients. Patients should be fully informed of the potential risks of the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, especially in pregnancy and in children.

Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility:
Long-term studies in animals have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxychloroquine sulfate.
The mutagenic potential of hydroxychloroquine was not evaluated. However, chloroquine has been shown to be a catalytic inhibitor of DNA repair enzymes (topoisomerase II) and to produce weak genotoxic effects through this mode of action.PregnancyTeratogenic Effects: Human pregnancies resulting in live births have been reported in the literature and no increase in the rate of birth defects has been demonstrated. Embryonic deaths and malformations of anophthalmia and microphthalmia in the offspring have been reported when pregnant rats received large doses of chloroquine.Nursing Mothers: Caution should be exercised when administering hydroxychloroquine sulfate to nursing women. It has been demonstrated that hydroxychloroquine administered to nursing women is excreted in human milk and it is known that infants are extremely sensitive to the toxic effects of 4-aminoquinolines.Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy have not been established in the chronic use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate for systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in children. Children are especially sensitive to the 4-aminoquinoline compounds. Most reported fatalities followed the accidental ingestion of chloroquine, sometimes in small doses (0.75 g or 1 g in one 3-year-old child). Patients should be strongly warned to keep these drugs out of the reach of children (see OVERDOSAGE).Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of hydroxychloroquine sulfate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.","PRECAUTIONS SECTION"
"908","210959","The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate or other 4-aminoquinoline compounds.

","ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION"
"909","210959","The 4-aminoquinoline compounds are very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion, and in accidental overdosage, or rarely with lower doses in hypersensitive patients, toxic symptoms may occur within 30 minutes. The symptoms of overdosage may include headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest. Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt. Immediate gastric lavage until the stomach is completely emptied is indicated.  After lavage, activated charcoal is introduced by the stomach tube within 30 minutes of ingestion of the drug may inhibit further intestinal absorption. To be effective, the dose of activated charcoal should be at least five times the estimated dose of hydroxychloroquine ingested.
Consideration should be given to administering diazepam parenterally since studies suggest that it may be beneficial in reversing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine cardiotoxicity.
Respiratory support and shock management should be instituted as necessary.
Exchange transfusions are used to reduce the level of 4-aminoquinoline drug in the blood.
A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed for at least six hours. Fluids may be forced and sufficient ammonium chloride (8 g daily in divided doses for adults) may be administered for a few days to acidify the urine. This will promote urinary excretion in cases of both overdosage and sensitivity.

"913","076392","Rx onlyAbsorption: The absolute oral bioavailability of mefloquine has not been determined since an intravenous formulation is not available. The bioavailability of the tablet formation compared with an oral solution was over 85%. The presence of food significantly enhances the rate and extent of absorption, leading to about a 40% increase in bioavailability. In healthy volunteers, plasma concentrations peak 6 to 24 hours (median, about 17 hours) after a single dose of mefloquine. In a similar group of volunteers, maximum plasma concentrations in mcg/L are roughly equivalent to the dose in milligrams (for example, a single 1000 mg dose produces a maximum concentration of about 1000 mcg/L). In healthy volunteers, a dose of 250 mg once weekly produces maximum steady-state plasma concentrations of 1000 to 2000 mcg/L, which are reached after 7 to 10 weeks.Distribution: In healthy adults, the apparent volume of distribution is approximately 20 L/kg, indicating extensive tissue distribution. Mefloquine may accumulate in parasitized erythrocytes. Experiments conducted in vitro with human blood using concentrations between 50 and 1000 mg/mL showed a relatively constant erythrocyte-to-plasma concentration ratio of about 2 to 1. The equilibrium reached in less than 30 minutes was found to be reversible. Protein binding is about 98%. Mefloquine crosses the placenta. Excretion into breast milk appears to be minimal (see PRECAUTIONS, Nursing Mothers).Metabolism: Mefloquine is extensively metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system. In vitro and in vivo studies strongly suggested that CYP3A4 is the major isoform involved.Two metabolites of mefloquine have been identified in humans. The main metabolite, 2,8-bis-trifluoromethyl-4-quinoline carboxylic acid, is inactive in Plasmodium falciparum. In a study in healthy volunteers, the carboxylic acid metabolite appeared in plasma 2 to 4 hours after a single oral dose. Maximum plasma concentrations of the metabolite, which were about 50% higher than those of mefloquine, were reached after 2 weeks. Thereafter, plasma levels of the main metabolite and mefloquine declined at a similar rate. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of the main metabolite was 3 to 5 times larger than that of the parent drug. The other metabolite, an alcohol, was present in minute quantities only.Elimination: In several studies in healthy adults, the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine varied between 2 and 4 weeks, with an average of about 3 weeks. Total clearance, which is essentially hepatic, is in the order of 30 mL/min. There is evidence that mefloquine is excreted mainly in the bile and feces. In volunteers, urinary excretion of unchanged mefloquine and its main metabolite under steady-state condition accounted for about 9% and 4% of the dose, respectively. Concentrations of other metabolites could not be measured in the urine.Pharmacokinetics in Special Clinical Situations: Children and the Elderly: No relevant age-related changes have been observed in the pharmacokinetics of mefloquine. Therefore, the dosage for children has been extrapolated from the recommended adult dose. No pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in patients with renal insufficiency since only a small proportion of the drug is eliminated renally. Mefloquine and its main metabolite are not appreciably removed by hemodialysis. No special chemoprophylactic dosage adjustments are indicated for dialysis patients to achieve concentrations in plasma similar to those in healthy persons.Although clearance of mefloquine may increase in late pregnancy, in general, pregnancy has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of mefloquine.The pharmacokinetics of mefloquine may be altered in acute malaria.Pharmacokinetic differences have been observed between various ethnic populations. In practice, however, these are of minor importance compared with host immune status and sensitivity of the parasite.During long-term prophylaxis (>2 years), the trough concentrations and the elimination half-life of mefloquine were similar to those obtained in the same population after 6 months of drug use, which is when they reached steady-state.In vitro and in vivo studies showed no hemolysis associated with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (seeANIMAL TOXICOLOGY).Mechanism of Action: Mefloquine is an antimalarial agent which acts as a blood schizonticide. Its exact mechanism of action is not known.Activity In Vitro and In Vivo: Mefloquine is active against the erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium species (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE). However, the drug has no effect against the exoerythrocytic (hepatic) stages of the parasite. Mefloquine is effective against malaria parasites resistant to chloroquine (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).Drug Resistance: Strains of P. falciparum with decreased susceptibility to mefloquine can be selected in vitro or in vivo. Resistance of P. falciparum to mefloquine has been reported in areas of multi-drug resistance in South East Asia. Increased incidences of resistance have also been reported in other parts of the world.Cross-Resistance: Cross-resistance between mefloquine and halofantrine and cross-resistance between mefloquine and quinine have been observed in some regions.Mefloquine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate acute malaria caused by mefloquine-susceptible strains of P. falciparum (both chloroquine-susceptible and resistant strains) or by Plasmodium vivax. There are insufficient clinical data to document the effect of mefloquine in malaria caused by P. ovale or P. malariae.
Note: Patients with acute P. vivax malaria, treated with mefloquine, are at high risk of relapse because mefloquine does not eliminate exoerythrocytic (hepatic phase) parasites. To avoid relapse, after initial treatment of the acute infection with mefloquine, patients should subsequently be treated with an 8-aminoquinoline derivative (e.g., primaquine).Mefloquine Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis of P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria infections, including prophylaxis of chloroquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum.
Halofantrine should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Elimination).Ketoconazole should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval. Ketoconazole increases plasma concentrations and elimination half-life of mefloquine following coadministration (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics, Elimination and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).Concomitant administration of mefloquine and quinine or quinidine may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities.Mefloquine may cause neuropsychiatric adverse reactions in adults and children. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can be difficult to identify in children. Therefore, vigilance is required to monitor for the occurrence of these symptoms, especially in nonverbal children.Psychiatric symptoms ranging from anxiety, paranoia, and depression to hallucinations and psychotic behavior can occur with mefloquine use. Symptoms may occur early in the course of mefloquine use. In some cases, these symptoms have been reported to continue for months or years after mefloquine has been stopped. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicide have been reported.Mefloquine should not be prescribed for prophylaxis in patients with active depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, or schizophrenia or other major psychiatric disorders. Mefloquine should be used with caution in patients with a previous history of depression.During prophylactic use, the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms such as acute anxiety, depression, restlessness or confusion suggest a risk for more serious psychiatric disturbances or neurologic adverse reactions. In these cases, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative medication should be substituted.Neurologic symptoms such as dizziness or vertigo, tinnitus, and loss of balance have been reported. These adverse reactions may occur early in the course of mefloquine use and in some cases have been reported to continue for months or years after mefloquine has been stopped. Dizziness or vertigo, tinnitus, and loss of balance have been reported to be permanent in some cases. During prophylactic use, if neurologic symptoms occur, the drug should be discontinued and an alternative medication should be substituted.Caution should be exercised with regard to activities requiring alertness and fine motor coordination, such as driving, piloting aircraft, operating machinery, and deep-sea diving, while symptoms persist.Mefloquine may increase the risk of convulsions in patients with epilepsy. The drug should therefore be prescribed only for curative treatment in such patients and only if there are compelling medical reasons for its use (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions).Concomitant administration of mefloquine and quinine or chloroquine may increase the risk of convulsions.Eye disorders, including but not limited to optic neuropathy and retinal disorders, have been reported during treatment with mefloquine. Any patient presenting with visual symptoms should be referred to the treating physician and an ophthalmologist as certain conditions (such as retinal disorders or optic neuropathy) may require stopping treatment with mefloquine (see PRECAUTIONS, ANIMAL
TOXICOLOGY).Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with mefloquine use.In patients with impaired liver function the elimination of mefloquine may be prolonged, leading to higher plasma levels and a higher risk of adverse reactions.This drug has been administered for longer than one year. If the drug is to be administered for a prolonged period, periodic evaluations including liver function tests and evaluations for neuropsychiatric effects should be performed (see WARNINGS  and ADVERSE REACTIONS, Postmarketing). Periodic ophthalmic examinations are recommended (see WARNINGS). Parenteral studies in animals show that mefloquine, a myocardial depressant, possesses 20% of the anti-fibrillatory action of quinidine and produces 50% of the increase in the PR interval reported with quinine. The effect of mefloquine on the compromised cardiovascular system has not been evaluated. However, transitory and clinically silent ECG alterations have been reported during the use of mefloquine; alterations included sinus bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, first degree AV-block, prolongation of the QTc interval and abnormal T waves (see also cardiovascular effects under PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions and ADVERSE REACTIONS). The benefits of mefloquine therapy should be weighed against the possibility of adverse effects in patients with cardiac disease.Geographical drug resistance patterns of P. falciparum occur and the preferred choice of malaria prophylaxis might be different from one area to another. For example, resistance of P. falciparum to mefloquine has been reported, predominantly in areas of multi-drug resistance in South-East Asia. Cross-resistance between mefloquine and halofantrine and cross-resistance between mefloquine and quinine have been observed in some regions.Cases of agranulocytosis and aplastic anemia have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).Halofantrine should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval (see WARNINGS).Concomitant administration of mefloquine and other related antimalarial compounds (e.g., quinine, quinidine and chloroquine) may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities and increase the risk of convulsions (see WARNINGS). If these drugs are to be used in the initial treatment of severe malaria, mefloquine administration should be delayed at least 12 hours after the last dose. Clinically significant QTc prolongation has not been found with mefloquine alone.Coadministration of a single 500 mg oral dose of mefloquine with 400 mg of ketoconazole once daily for 10 days in 8 healthy volunteers resulted in an increase in the mean Cmax and AUC of mefloquine by 64% and 79%, respectively, and an increase in the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine from 322 hours to 448 hours. Ketoconazole should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval (see WARNINGS).Coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (e.g., anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval. There are no data that conclusively establish whether the concomitant administration of mefloquine and the above listed agents has an effect on cardiac function.In patients taking an anticonvulsant (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin), the concomitant use of mefloquine may reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of the anticonvulsant. Therefore, patients concurrently taking anti-seizure medication and mefloquine should have the blood level of their anti-seizure medication monitored and the dosage adjusted appropriately (see PRECAUTIONS).When mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccines, attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded. Vaccinations with attenuated live bacteria should therefore be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets.Coadministration of a single 500 mg oral dose of mefloquine and 600 mg of rifampin once daily for 7 days in 7 healthy Thai volunteers resulted in a decrease in the mean Cmax and AUC of mefloquine by 19% and 68%, respectively, and a decrease in the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine from 305 hours to 113 hours. Rifampin should be used cautiously in patients taking mefloquine.Mefloquine does not inhibit or induce the CYP 450 enzyme system. Thus, concomitant administration of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets and substrates of the CYP 450 enzyme system is not expected to result in a drug interaction. However, mefloquine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may modify the pharmacokinetics/metabolism of mefloquine, leading to an increase in mefloquine plasma concentrations and potential risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Similarly, inducers of CYP3A4 may modify the pharmacokinetics/metabolism of mefloquine, leading to a decrease in mefloquine plasma concentrations and potential reduction in efficacy of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets. Therefore, mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should also be used with caution when administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 inducers.It has been shown in vitro that mefloquine is a substrate and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Therefore, drug-drug interactions could also occur with drugs that are substrates or are known to modify the expression of this transporter. The clinical relevance of these interactions is not known to date.No other drug interactions are known. Nevertheless, the effects of mefloquine on travelers receiving concomitant medications, particularly diabetics or patients using anticoagulants, should be checked before departure.In clinical trials, the concomitant administration of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine did not alter the adverse reaction profile of mefloquine.Data from published studies in pregnant women have shown no increase in the risk of teratogenic effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes following mefloquine treatment or prophylaxis during pregnancy. Reproduction studies in mice, rats and rabbits have shown teratogenic effects at doses similar to the clinical acute treatment dose in humans. Because the studies in humans cannot rule out the possibility of harm, mefloquine should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.Published data on mefloquine use during pregnancy include randomized controlled trials, intervention trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series. These data showed that pregnant women who took mefloquine at various doses for both prevention and treatment of malaria did not have an increased risk of teratogenic effects or adverse pregnancy outcomes compared to the background rate in the general population. These data include more than 700 exposures to mefloquine in the first trimester of pregnancy and over 2,000 exposures in the second and third trimester.Mefloquine administered to pregnant mice, rats, and rabbits was teratogenic at doses similar to the clinical acute treatment dose of 21 to 25 mg/kg, based on body surface area comparisons. In all three animal species, CNS effects (e.g., exencephaly, hydrocephaly or partially missing medulla oblongata) and craniofacial malformations were observed. At the same doses, mefloquine was also embryotoxic in mice and rabbits. All of these findings were observed at doses that were maternally toxic.At the doses used for treatment of acute malaria infections, the symptoms possibly attributable to drug administration cannot be distinguished from those symptoms usually attributable to the disease itself.Among subjects who received mefloquine for prophylaxis of malaria, the most frequently observed adverse experience was vomiting (3%). Dizziness, syncope, extrasystoles and other complaints affecting less than 1% were also reported.Two serious adverse reactions were cardiopulmonary arrest in one patient shortly after ingesting a single prophylactic dose of mefloquine while concomitantly using propranolol (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions), and encephalopathy of unknown etiology during prophylactic mefloquine administration. The relationship of encephalopathy to drug administration could not be clearly established.Among subjects who received mefloquine for treatment, the most frequently observed adverse experiences included: dizziness, myalgia, nausea, fever, headache, vomiting, chills, diarrhea, skin rash, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, and tinnitus. Those side effects occurring in less than 1% included bradycardia, hair loss, emotional problems, pruritus, asthenia, transient emotional disturbances and telogen effluvium (loss of resting hair). Seizures have also been reported.The most frequently observed laboratory alterations which could be possibly attributable to drug administration were decreased hematocrit, transient elevation of transaminases, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. These alterations were observed in patients with acute malaria who received treatment doses of the drug and were attributed to the disease itself.During prophylactic administration of mefloquine to indigenous populations in malaria-endemic areas, the following alterations in laboratory values were observed: transient elevation of transaminases, leukocytosis or thrombocytopenia.Because of the long half-life of mefloquine, adverse reactions to mefloquine may occur or persist up to several weeks after discontinuation of the drug.Postmarketing surveillance indicates that the same kind of adverse reactions are reported during prophylaxis, as well as acute treatment. Because these adverse reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to mefloquine exposure.The most frequently reported adverse reactions are nausea, vomiting, loose stools or diarrhea, abdominal pain, dizziness or vertigo, loss of balance, and neuropsychiatric events such as headache, somnolence, and sleep disorders (insomnia, abnormal dreams). These adverse reactions may occur early in the course of mefloquine use. It has been reported that dizziness or vertigo, tinnitus and hearing impairment, and loss of balance may continue for months or years after discontinuation of the drug and may be permanent in some cases.More severe neuropsychiatric disorders have been reported such as: sensory and motor neuropathies (including paresthesia, tremor and ataxia), convulsions, agitation or restlessness, anxiety, depression, mood swings, panic attacks, memory impairment, confusion, hallucinations, aggression, psychotic or paranoid reactions and encephalopathy. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicide have been reported.Other less frequently reported adverse reactions include:Cardiovascular Disorders: circulatory disturbances (hypotension, hypertension, flushing, syncope), chest pain, tachycardia or palpitation, bradycardia, irregular heart rate, extrasystoles, A-V block, and other transient cardiac conduction alterations.Skin Disorders: rash, exanthema, erythema, urticaria, pruritus, edema, hair loss, erythema multiforme, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome.Musculoskeletal Disorders: muscle weakness, muscle cramps, myalgia, and arthralgia.Respiratory Disorders: dyspnea, pneumonitis of possible allergic etiology.Hepatobiliary Disorders: drug-related hepatic disorders from asymptomatic transient transaminase elevations to hepatic failure.Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders: agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia.Ocular Disorders: visual impairment, vision blurred, cataracts, retinal disorders, optic neuropathy.Other Symptoms: asthenia, malaise, fatigue, fever, hyperhidrosis, chills, dyspepsia and loss of appetite.In cases of overdosage with mefloquine, the symptoms mentioned under ADVERSE REACTIONS may be more pronounced. Patients should be managed by symptomatic and supportive care following mefloquine overdose. There are no specific antidotes. Monitor cardiac function (if possible by ECG) and neuropsychiatric status. Provide symptomatic and intensive supportive treatment as required.Treatment of mild to moderate malaria in adults caused by mefloquine-susceptible strains of P. falciparum or by P. vivax: Dosage: Five tablets (1250 mg) mefloquine hydrochloride to be given as a single oral dose. The drug should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be administered with at least 8 oz (240 mL) of water. If a full-treatment course with mefloquine does not lead to improvement within 48 to 72 hours, mefloquine should not be used for retreatment. An alternative therapy should be used. Similarly, if previous prophylaxis with mefloquine failed, mefloquine should not be used for curative treatment (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE).Note: Patients with acute P. vivax malaria, treated with mefloquine, are at high risk of relapse because mefloquine does not eliminate exoerythrocytic (hepatic phase) parasites. To avoid relapse after initial treatment of the acute infection with mefloquine, patients should subsequently be treated with an 8-aminoquinoline derivative (e.g., primaquine). Dosage: One 250 mg mefloquine hydrochloride tablet once weekly.Prophylactic drug administration should begin 1 week before arrival in an endemic area. Subsequent weekly doses should be taken regularly, always on the same day of each week, preferably after the main meal. To reduce the risk of malaria after leaving an endemic area, prophylaxis must be continued for 4 additional weeks to ensure suppressive blood levels of the drug when merozoites emerge from the liver. Tablets should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be administered with at least 8 oz (240 mL) of water.In certain cases, e.g., when a traveler is taking other medication, it may be desirable to start prophylaxis 2 to 3 weeks prior to departure, in order to ensure that the combination of drugs is well tolerated (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).When prophylaxis with mefloquine fails, physicians should carefully evaluate which antimalarial to use for therapy.Treatment of mild to moderate malaria in pediatric patients caused by mefloquine-susceptible strains of P. falciparum: Dosage: 20 to 25 mg/kg body weight. Splitting the total therapeutic dose into 2 doses taken 6 to 8 hours apart may reduce the occurrence or severity of adverse effects. The pediatric dose should not exceed the adult dose. Experience with mefloquine in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg is limited. The drug should not be taken on an empty stomach and should be administered with ample water. The tablets may be crushed and suspended in a small amount of water, milk or other beverage for administration to small children and other persons unable to swallow them whole.If a full-treatment course with mefloquine does not lead to improvement within 48 to 72 hours, mefloquine should not be used for retreatment. An alternative therapy should be used. Similarly, if previous prophylaxis with mefloquine has failed, mefloquine should not be used for curative treatment.In pediatric patients, the administration of mefloquine for the treatment of malaria has been associated with early vomiting. In some cases, early vomiting has been cited as a possible cause of treatment failure (see PRECAUTIONS). If a significant loss of drug product is observed or suspected because of vomiting, a second full dose of mefloquine should be administered to patients who vomit less than 30 minutes after receiving the drug. If vomiting occurs 30 to 60 minutes after a dose, an additional half-dose should be given. If vomiting recurs, the patient should be monitored closely and alternative malaria treatment considered if improvement is not observed within a reasonable period of time.The safety and effectiveness of mefloquine to treat malaria in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established.The recommended prophylactic dose of mefloquine is approximately 5 mg/kg body weight once weekly. One 250 mg mefloquine hydrochloride tablet should be taken once weekly in pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg. In pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg, the weekly dose decreases in proportion to body weight:30 to 45 kg: 3/4 tablet20 to 30 kg: 1/2 tabletExperience with mefloquine in pediatric patients weighing less than 20 kg is limited.Ocular lesions were observed in rats fed mefloquine daily for 2 years. All surviving rats given 30 mg/kg/day had ocular lesions in both eyes characterized by retinal degeneration, opacity of the lens, and retinal edema. Similar but less severe lesions were observed in 80% of female and 22% of male rats fed 12.5 mg/kg/day for 2 years. At doses of 5 mg/kg/day, only corneal lesions were observed. They occurred in 9% of rats studied.Male Wistar rats orally administered-mefloquine daily for 22 days at the equivalent human therapeutic plasma concentration showed CNS penetration of mefloquine, with a 30 to 50 fold greater brain/plasma drug ratio up to 10 days after the final dose administered.1

It is important that you read the entire Medication Guide for additional information on mefloquine. 
Carry this wallet card with you when you are taking mefloquine.
 Important: You need to take malaria prevention medicine before you travel to a malaria area, while you are in a malaria area, and after you return from a malaria area.
Mefloquine can cause serious side effects,
including:
1. Heart problems.
Do not take halofantrine (used to treat malaria) or ketoconazole (used for fungal infections) with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of your last dose of mefloquine. You may get serious heart problems that can lead to death. Do not take quinine (Qualaquin) or quinidine (used to treat malaria or irregular heart beat) with mefloquine. You may get serious heart problems. Mefloquine may cause serious problems with the electrical system of your heart, called QT prolongation.
2. Mental problems. Symptoms of serious mental problems may include severe anxiety, paranoia (feelings of mistrust towards others), hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not there), depression, feeling restless, unusual behavior or feeling confused. Some people who take mefloquine think about suicide (putting an end to their life). Some people who were taking mefloquine committed suicide. It is not known if mefloquine was responsible for those suicides.
If you have any of these serious mental problems you should contact your doctor right away as it may be necessary to stop taking mefloquine and use a different medicine to prevent malaria.
3. Problems with your body’s nervous system.
Do not take quinine (Qualaquin) or chloroquine (Aralen) (used to treat malaria) with mefloquine. You may have a greater risk for convulsions (seizures).
Symptoms of serious nervous system problems may include dizziness, a feeling that you or things around you are moving or spinning (vertigo), loss of balance, ringing in your ears (tinnitus), convulsions (seizures) in people who already have seizures, or you are unable to sleep (insomnia).
 These serious mental and nervous system side effects can go on for months or years after mefloquine is stopped or may become
permanent in some people.
If you are told by a doctor to stop taking mefloquine because of the side effects or for other reasons, you will need to take a different malaria medicine.
If you do not have access to a doctor or to a
different medicine and have to stop taking
mefloquine, leave the malaria area and contact a doctor as soon as possible because leaving the malaria area may not protect you from getting malaria. You will still need to take a malaria prevention medicine for another 4 weeks after you leave the malaria area.
Mefloquine may cause serious liver problems.
Symptoms of liver problems include nausea,
vomiting, loss of appetite, unusual tiredness,
stomach pain, fever, weakness, itching, light-colored bowel movements, dark colored urine, yellowing of your skin or the white of your eyes. The most common side effects of mefloquine include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and headache.
Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of mefloquine. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Call your doctor for medical advice about side
effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.
What should I avoid while taking mefloquine?
Avoid activities such as driving a car or using heavy machinery or other activities needing alertness and careful movements (fine motor coordination) until you know how mefloquine affects you. You may feel dizzy or lose your balance. This could happen for months or years after you stop taking mefloquine and can be permanent in some cases.

"966","090610","Chloroquine phosphate, USP is a 4-aminoquinoline compound for oral administration. It is a white crystalline powder, odorless, has a bitter taste, and is discolored slowly on exposure to light. It is freely soluble in water, practically insoluble in alcohol, in chloroform and in ether.Chloroquine phosphate, USP is an antimalarial and amebicidal drug.Chemically, it is 7-chloro-4-[[4-(diethylamino)-1-methylbutyl]amino] quinoline phosphate (1:2) and has the following structural formula:C18H26CIN3.2H3P04                                                                     Molecular Weight: 515.86Each tablet contains 250 mg of chloroquine phosphate USP, equivalent to 150 mg chloroquine base.Inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, corn starch, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol 400, polyethylene glycol 3350, polysorbate 80, povidone, sodium starch glycolate, talc, and titanium dioxide.","DESCRIPTION SECTION"
"967","090610","Chloroquine is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and only a small proportion of the administered dose is found in the stools. Approximately 55% of the drug in the plasma is bound to nondiffusible plasma constituents. Excretion of chloroquine is quite slow but is increased by acidification of the urine. Chloroquine is deposited in the tissues in considerable amounts. In animals, from 200 to 700 times the plasma concentration may be found in the liver, spleen, kidney, and lung; leukocytes also concentrate the drug. The brain and spinal cord, in contrast, contain only 10 to 30 times the amount present in plasma.Chloroquine undergoes appreciable degradation in the body. The main metabolite is desethylchloroquine, which accounts for one fourth of the total material appearing in the urine; bisdesethylchloroquine, a carboxylic acid derivative, and other metabolic products as yet uncharacterized are found in small amounts. Slightly more than half of the urinary drug products can be accounted for as unchanged chloroquine.","CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY SECTION"
"968","090610","Mechanism of Action: Chloroquine, a 4-aminoquinoline, is an anti-protozoal agent. The precise mechanism by which chloroquine exhibits activity is not known. Chloroquine, may exert its effect against Plasmodium species by concentrating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and by inhibiting polymerization of heme. It can also inhibit certain enzymes by its interaction with DNA. Activity in Vitro and in Clinical Infections: Chloroquine is active against the erythrocytic forms of susceptible strains of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium vivax. Chloroquine is not active against the gametocytes and the exoerythrocytic forms including the hypnozoite stage (P. vivax and P. ovale) of the Plasmodium parasites. In vitro studies with Chloroquine demonstrated that it is active against the trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica. Drug Resistance: Resistance of Plasmodium parasites to chloroquine is widespread (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Limitations of Use in Malaria and WARNINGS). Plasmodium parasites exhibiting reduced susceptibility to hydroxychloroquine also show reduced susceptibility to chloroquine. Patients in whom chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have failed to prevent or cure clinical malaria or parasitemia, or patients who acquired malaria in a geographic area where chloroquine resistance is known to occur should be treated with another form of antimalarial therapy (see WARNINGS and INDICATIONS AND USAGE, Limitations of Use). ","MICROBIOLOGY SECTION"
"969","090610","Chloroquine phosphate tablets are indicated for the: Treatmentof uncomplicated malaria due to susceptible strains of P. falciparum,P.malariae, P. ovale , and P.vivax.
Prophylaxisof malaria in geographic areas where resistance to chloroquine is notpresent.Treatmentof extraintestinal amebiasis.Chloroquine phosphate tablets do not prevent relapses in patients with vivax or ovale malaria because it is not effective against exoerythrocytic forms of the parasites. Limitations of Use in Malaria: Do not use chloroquine phosphatetablets for the treatment of complicated malaria (high-grade parasitemiaand/or complications e.g., cerebral malaria or acute renal failure).Donot use chloroquine phosphate tablets for malaria prophylaxis in areaswhere chloroquine resistance occurs, Resistance to chloroquine phosphatetabletsis widespread in P. falciparum,and is reportedin P.vivax(see WARNINGS).Concomitanttherapy with an 8-aminoquinoline drug is necessary for treatment of thehypnozoite liver stage forms of P.vivaxand P.ovale(see DOSAGEAND ADMINISTRATION).","INDICATIONS & USAGE SECTION"
"970","090610","Use of chloroquine phosphate for indications other than acute malaria is contraindicated in the presence of retinal or visual field changes of any etiology.Use of chloroquine phosphate is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 4-aminoquinoline compounds. ","CONTRAINDICATIONS SECTION"
"971","090610","Antacids and kaolin: Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Cimetidine: Cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of chloroquine, increasing its plasma level. Concomitant use of cimetidine should be avoided. Insulin and other antidiabetic drugs: As chloroquine may enhance the effects of a hypoglycemic treatment, a decrease in doses of insulin or other antidiabetic drugs may be required. Arrhythmogenic drugs: There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if chloroquine is used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs, such as amiodarone or moxifloxacin. Ampicillin: In a study of healthy volunteers, chloroquine significantly reduced the bioavailability of ampicillin. An interval of at least two hours between intake of ampicillin and chloroquine should be observed. Cyclosporine: After introduction of chloroquine (oral form), a sudden increase in serum cyclosporine level has been reported. Therefore, close monitoring of serum cyclosporine level is recommended and, if necessary, chloroquine should be discontinued. Mefloquine: Co-administration of chloroquine and mefloquine may increase the risk of convulsions. The blood concentrations of chloroquine and desethylchloroquine (the major metabolite of chloroquine, which also has antimalarial properties) were negatively associated with log antibody titers. Chloroquine taken in the dose recommended for malaria prophylaxis can reduce the antibody response to primary immunization with intradermal human diploid-cell rabies vaccine. Praziquantel: In a single-dose interaction study, chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Tamoxifen: Concomitant use of chloroquine with drugs known to induce retinal toxicity such as tamoxifen is not recommended (see WARNINGS). ","DRUG INTERACTIONS SECTION"
"972","090610","See WARNINGS, Usage in Pregnancy. ","PREGNANCY SECTION"
"973","090610","Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from chloroquine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the potential clinical benefit of the drug to the mother. The excretion of chloroquine and the major metabolite, desethylchloroquine, in breast milk was investigated in eleven lactating mothers following a single oral dose of chloroquine (600 mg base). The maximum daily dose of the drug that the infant can receive from breastfeeding was about 0.7% of the maternal start dose of the drug in malaria chemotherapy. Separate chemoprophylaxis for the infant is required (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). ","NURSING MOTHERS SECTION"
"974","090610","See WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.","PEDIATRIC USE SECTION"
"975","090610","Clinical studies of chloroquine phosphate did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. However, this drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection and it may be useful to monitor renal function.","GERIATRIC USE SECTION"
"976","090610","The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of chloroquine or other 4-aminoqunoline compounds. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ocular disorders: Maculopathy and macular degeneration have been reported and may be irreversible. Irreversible retinopathy with retinal pigmentation changes (bull's eye appearance) and visual field defects (paracentral scotomas) in patients receiving long-term or high-dosage 4-aminoquinoline therapy have been reported (see WARNINGS). Visual disturbances (blurring of vision and difficulty of focusing or accommodation); nyctalopia; scotomatous vision with field defects of paracentral, pericentral ring types, and typically temporal scotomas (e.g., difficulty in reading with words tending to disappear, seeing half an object, misty vision, and fog before the eyes) have been reported. Reversible corneal opacities have also been reported. Immune system disorders: Urticaria, anaphylactic reaction including angioedema. Ear and labyrinth disorders: Nerve type deafness; tinnitus, reduced hearing in patients with preexisting auditory damage. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue-disorders: Sensorimotor disorders, skeletal muscle myopathy or neuromyopathy leading to progressive weakness and atrophy of proximal muscle groups, depression of tendon reflexes and abnormal nerve conduction. Gastrointestinal disorders: Hepatitis, increased liver enzymes, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis. Pleomorphic skin eruptions, skin and mucosal pigmentary changes; lichen planus-like eruptions, pruritus,; drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS syndrome); photosensitivity and hair loss and bleaching of hair pigment. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: Pancytopenia, aplastic anemia, reversible agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Hemolytic anemia in G6PD deficient patients (see PRECAUTIONS). Nervous system disorders: Convulsions, mild and transient headache, polyneuropathy, acute extrapyramidal disorders (such as dystonia, dyskinesia, tongue protrusion, torticollis) (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE). Neuropsychiatric disorders: Neuropsychiatric changes including psychosis, delirium, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, confusion, hallucinations, personality changes, depression, and suicidal behavior. Cardiac disorders: Hypotension, electrocardiographic changes (particularly, inversion or depression of the T-wave with widening of the QRS complex), and cardiomyopathy (which may result in cardiac failure and in some cases a fatal outcome). Cardiac arrhythmias, conduction disorders such as bundle branch block / atrio-ventricular block, QT interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation have been reported with therapeutic doses of chloroquine as well as with overdose. The risk is greater if chloroquine is administered at high doses. Fatal cases have been reported (see WARNINGS, Cardiac Effects and OVERDOSAGE). Metabolic and Nutritional disorders: Hypoglycemia (see WARNINGS).","ADVERSE REACTIONS SECTION"
"977","090610","Signs and Symptoms: Chloroquine is very rapidly and completely absorbed after ingestion. Toxic doses of chloroquine can be fatal. As little as 1 g may be fatal in children. Toxic symptoms can occur within minutes. The symptoms of overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, headache, drowsiness, visual disturbances, cardiovascular collapse, convulsions, hypokalemia, rhythm and conduction disorders including QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, followed by sudden potentially fatal respiratory and cardiac arrest. Immediate medical attention is required, as these effects may appear shortly after the overdose. Cases of extrapyramidal disorders have also been reported in the context of chloroquine overdose (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Treatment: Treatment is symptomatic and must be prompt with immediate evacuation of the stomach by emesis or gastric lavage followed by treatment with activated charcoal. Chloroquine overdose is a life-threatening emergency and should be managed with cardio-respiratory and hemodynamic support, monitoring of potassium along with management of arrhythmias and convulsions, as necessary. A patient who survives the acute phase and is asymptomatic should be closely observed until all clinical features of toxicity resolve.","OVERDOSAGE SECTION"
"978","090610","The dosage of chloroquine phosphate is often expressed in terms of equivalent chloroquine base. Each 250 mg tablet of chloroquine phosphate contains the equivalent of 150 mg chloroquine base. In infants and children the dosage is preferably calculated by body weight. Prophylaxis against chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium species Adult Dose: The dosage for prophylaxis is 500 mg (= 300 mg base) administered once per week on exactly the same day of each week. Pediatric Dose: The dosage for prophylaxis is 5 mg calculated as base, per kg of body weight, administered once per week on exactly the same day of each week. The pediatric dose should never exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. If circumstances permit, suppressive therapy should begin two weeks prior to exposure. However, failing this in adults, an initial double (loading) dose of 1 g (= 600 mg base), or in children 10 mg base/kg may be taken in two divided doses, six hours apart. The suppressive therapy should be continued for eight weeks after leaving the endemic area. Treatment of uncomplicated malaria due to chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium species Adults: An initial dose of 1 g salt (= 600 mg base) followed by an additional 500 mg (= 300 mg base) after six to eight hours and a single dose of 500 mg (= 300 mg base) on each of two consecutive days. This represents a total dose of 2.5 g chloroquine phosphate or 1.5 g base in three days. Infants and Children: In infants and children, the recommended dose is 10 mg base/kg followed by 5 mg based/kg at 6, 24 and 36 hours (total dose 25 mg based/kg). The pediatric dose should never exceed the adult dose regardless of weight. The dosage for adults of low body weight and for infants and children should be determined as follows: First dose: 10 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 600 mg base). Second dose: (6 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg (but not exceeding a single dose of 300 mg base). Third dose: (24 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg. Fourth dose: (36 hours after first dose) 5 mg base per kg. P. vivax and P. ovale: Concomitant therapy with an 8-aminoquinoline compound is necessary for treatment of the hypnozoite liver stage forms of the parasites. Extraintestinal Amebiasis: Adults Dosage: 1 g salt (600 mg base) daily for two days, followed by 500 mg (300 mg base) daily for at least two to three weeks. Treatment is usually combined with an effective intestinal amebicide. Geriatric Use See PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use.","DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION SECTION"

Absorption of atovaquone may be reduced in patients with diarrhea or vomiting. If atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride is used in patients who are vomiting, parasitemia should be closely monitored and the use of an antiemetic considered. 


[See Dosage and Administration (


2).] 


Vomiting occurred in up to 19% of pediatric patients given treatment doses ofatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. In the controlled clinical trials, 15.3% of adults received an antiemetic when they received atovaquone/proguanil and 98.3% of these patients were successfully treated.

Elevated liver laboratory tests and cases of hepatitis and hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation have been reported with prophylactic use of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride has not been evaluated for the treatment of cerebral malaria or other severe manifestations of complicated malaria, including hyperparasitemia, pulmonary edema, or renal failure. Patients with severe malaria are not candidates for oral therapyBecause clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Because the tablets contain Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride, the type and severity of adverse reactions associated with each of the compounds may be expected. The lower prophylactic doses of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride were better tolerated than the higher treatment doses. Prophylaxis of 


P. falciparum Malaria: 


In 3 clinical trials (2 of which were placebo-controlled) 381 adults (mean age 31 years) receivedatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridefor the prophylaxis of malaria; the majority of adults were black (90%) and 79% were male. In a clinical trial for the prophylaxis of malaria, 125 pediatric patients (mean age 9 years) receivedatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride; all subjects were black and 52% were male. Adverse experiences reported in adults and pediatric patients, considered attributable to therapy, occurred in similar proportions of subjects receivingatovaquone and proguanil hydrochlorideor placebo in all studies. Prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride was discontinued prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse experience in 3 of 381 (0.8%) adults and 0 of 125 pediatric patients. 


In a placebo-controlled study of malaria prophylaxis withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride involving 330 pediatric patients (aged 4 to 14 years) in Gabon, a malaria-endemic area, the safety profile ofatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridewas consistent with that observed in the earlier prophylactic studies in adults and pediatric patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridewere abdominal pain (13%), headache (13%), and cough (10%). Abdominal pain (13% vs. 8%) and vomiting (5% vs. 3%) were reported more often with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride than with placebo. No patient withdrew from the study due to an adverse experience with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. No routine laboratory data were obtained during this study. Non-immune travelers visiting a malaria-endemic area received MALARONE (n = 1,004) for prophylaxis of malaria in 2 active-controlled clinical trials. In one study (n = 493), the mean age of subjects was 33 years and 53% were male; 90% of subjects were white, 6% of subjects were black and the remaining were of other racial/ethnic groups. In the other study (n = 511), the mean age of subjects was 36 years and 51% were female; the majority of subjects (97%) were white. Adverse experiences occurred in a similar or lower proportion of subjects receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets than an active comparator (Table 1). Fewer neuropsychiatric adverse experiences occurred in subjects who received MALARONE than mefloquine. Fewer gastrointestinal adverse experiences occurred in subjects receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets than chloroquine/proguanil. Compared with active comparator drugs, subjects receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets had fewer adverse experiences overall that were attributed to prophylactic therapy (Table 1). Prophylaxis with MALARONE was discontinued prematurely due to a treatment-related adverse experience in 7 of 1,004 travelers.Table 1.

b Mean duration of dosing based on recommended dosing regimens. 


In a third active-controlled study, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (n = 110) was compared with chloroquine/proguanil (n = 111) for the prophylaxis of malaria in 221 non-immune pediatric patients (2 to 17 years of age). The mean duration of exposure was 23 days foratovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride , 46 days for chloroquine, and 43 days for proguanil, reflecting the different recommended dosage regimens for these products. Fewer patients treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride reported abdominal pain (2% vs. 7%) or nausea (<1% vs. 7%) than children who received chloroquine/proguanil. Oral ulceration (2% vs. 2%), vivid dreams (2% vs. <1%), and blurred vision (0% vs. 2%) occurred in similar proportions of patients receiving either atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride or chloroquine/proguanil, respectively. Two patients discontinued prophylaxis with chloroquine/proguanil due to adverse events, while none of those receiving atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride discontinued due to adverse events. Treatment of Acute, Uncomplicated 


P. falciparum Malaria: 


In 7 controlled trials, 436 adolescents and adults receivedatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridefor treatment of acute, uncomplicated 


P. falciparum malaria. The range of mean ages of subjects was 26 to 29 years; 79% of subjects were male. In these studies, 48% of subjects were classified as other racial/ethnic groups, primarily Asian; 42% of subjects were black and the remaining subjects were white. Attributable adverse experiences that occurred in =5% of patients were abdominal pain (17%), nausea (12%), vomiting (12%), headache (10%), diarrhea (8%), asthenia (8%), anorexia (5%), and dizziness (5%). Treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience in 4 of 436 (0.9%) adolescents and adults treated withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride . 


In 2 controlled trials, 116 pediatric patients (weighing 11 to 40 kg) (mean age 7 years) received atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridefor the treatment of malaria. The majority of subjects were black (72%); 28% were of other racial/ethnic groups, primarily Asian. Attributable adverse experiences that occurred in =5% of patients were vomiting (10%) and pruritus (6%). Vomiting occurred in 43 of 319 (13%) pediatric patients who did not have symptomatic malaria but were given treatment doses of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride for 3 days in a clinical trial. The design of this clinical trial required that any patient who vomited be withdrawn from the trial. Among pediatric patients with symptomatic malaria treated with MALARONE, treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience in 1 of 116 (0.9%). In a study of 100 pediatric patients (5 to <11 kg body weight) who receivedatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridefor the treatment of uncomplicated 


P. falciparum malaria, only diarrhea (6%) occurred in =5% of patients as an adverse experience attributable toatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. In 3 patients (3%), treatment was discontinued prematurely due to an adverse experience. 


Abnormalities in laboratory tests reported in clinical trials were limited to elevations of transaminases in malaria patients being treated withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride . The frequency of these abnormalities varied substantially across trials of treatment and were not observed in the randomized portions of the prophylaxis trials. One active-controlled trial evaluated the treatment of malaria in Thai adults (n = 182); the mean age of subjects was 26 years (range 15 to 63 years); 80% of subjects were male. Early elevations of ALT and AST occurred more frequently in patients treated withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride(n = 91) compared to patients treated with an active control, mefloquine (n = 91). On Day 7, rates of elevated ALT and AST withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochlorideand mefloquine (for patients who had normal baseline levels of these clinical laboratory parameters) were ALT 26.7% vs. 15.6%; AST 16.9% vs. 8.6%, respectively. By Day 14 of this 28-day study, the frequency of transaminase elevations equalized across the 2 groupsIn addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been identified during postmarketing use ofatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride . Because they are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made. These events have been chosen for inclusion due to a combination of their seriousness, frequency of reporting, or potential causal connection toatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride.

Proguanil may potentiate the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and other coumarin-based anticoagulants. The mechanism of this potential drug interaction has not been established. Caution is advised when initiating or withdrawing malaria prophylaxis or treatment withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride in patients on continuous treatment with coumarin-based anticoagulants. When these products are administered concomitantly, coagulation tests should be closely monitored.

Do not useatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride for malaria prophylaxis in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). Use with caution for the treatment of malaria in patients with severe renal impairment, only if the benefits of the 3-day treatment regimen outweigh the potential risks associated with increased drug exposure. No dosage adjustments are needed in patients with mild (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min) or moderate (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) renal impairment.

Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridewas evaluated for prophylaxis of 


P. falciparum malaria in 5 clinical trials in malaria-endemic areas and in 3 active-controlled trials in non-immune travelers to malaria-endemic areas. 


Three placebo-controlled trials of 10 to 12 weeks’ duration were conducted among residents of malaria-endemic areas in Kenya, Zambia, and Gabon. The mean age of subjects was 30 (range 17-55), 32 (range 16-64), and 10 (range 5-16) years, respectively. Of a total of 669 randomized patients (including 264 pediatric patients 5 to 16 years of age), 103 were withdrawn for reasons other than falciparum malaria or drug-related adverse events (55% of these were lost to follow-up and 45% were withdrawn for protocol violations).

In another study, 330 Gabonese pediatric patients (weighing 13 to 40 kg, and aged 4 to 14 years) who had received successful open-label radical cure treatment with artesunate, were randomized to receive eitheratovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride(dosage based on body weight) or placebo in a double-blind fashion for 12 weeks. Blood smears were obtained weekly and any time malaria was suspected. Nineteen of the 165 children givenatovaquone and proguanil hydrochlorideand 18 of 165 patients given placebo withdrew from the study for reasons other than parasitemia (primary reason was lost to follow-up). One out of 150 evaluable patients (<1%) who receivedatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridedeveloped


P. falciparum parasitemia while receiving prophylaxis with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridecompared with 31 (22%) of the 144 evaluable placebo recipients. 


In a 10-week study in 175 South African subjects who moved into malaria-endemic areas and were given prophylaxis with 1atovaquone and proguanil hydrochlorideTablet daily, parasitemia developed in 1 subject who missed several doses of medication. Since no placebo control was included, the incidence of malaria in this study was not known. Two active-controlled trials were conducted in non-immune travelers who visited a malaria-endemic area. The mean duration of travel was 18 days (range 2 to 38 days). Of a total of 1,998 randomized patients who receivedatovaquone and proguanil hydrochlorideor controlled drug, 24 discontinued from the study before follow-up evaluation 60 days after leaving the endemic area. Nine of these were lost to follow-up, 2 withdrew because of an adverse experience, and 13 were discontinued for other reasons. These trials were not large enough to allow for statements of comparative efficacy. In addition, the true exposure rate to 


P. falciparum malaria in both trials is unknown. The results are listed in Table 5.

A third randomized, open-label study was conducted which included 221 otherwise healthy pediatric patients (weighing =11 kg and 2 to 17 years of age) who were at risk of contracting malaria by traveling to an endemic area. The mean duration of travel was 15 days (range 1 to 30 days). Prophylaxis withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (n = 110, dosage based on body weight) began 1 or 2 days before entering the endemic area and lasted until 7 days after leaving the area. A control group (n = 111) received prophylaxis with chloroquine/proguanil dosed according to WHO guidelines. No cases of malaria occurred in either group of children. However, the study was not large enough to allow for statements of comparative efficacy. In addition, the true exposure rate to 


P. falciparum malaria in this study is unknown. 


Causal Prophylaxis: In separate trials with small numbers of volunteers, atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride were independently shown to have causal prophylactic activity directed against liver-stage parasites of 


P. falciparum. Six patients given a single dose of atovaquone 250 mg 24 hours prior to malaria challenge were protected from developing malaria, whereas all 4 placebo-treated patients developed malaria.


During the 4 weeks following cessation of prophylaxis in clinical trial participants who remained in malaria-endemic areas and were available for evaluation, malaria developed in 24 of 211 (11.4%) subjects who took placebo and 9 of 328 (2.7%) who tookatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. While new infections could not be distinguished from recrudescent infections, all but 1 of the infections in patients treated withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochlorideoccurred more than 15 days after stopping therapy. The single case occurring on day 8 following cessation of therapy withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride probably represents a failure of prophylaxis withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. The possibility that delayed cases of 


P. falciparum malaria may occur some time after stopping prophylaxis withatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridecannot be ruled out. Hence, returning travelers developing febrile illnesses should be investigated for malaria. 


In 3 phase II clinical trials, atovaquone alone, proguanil hydrochloride alone, and the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride were evaluated for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by 


P. falciparum. Among 156 evaluable patients, the parasitological cure rate (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) was 59/89 (66%) with atovaquone alone, 1/17 (6%) with proguanil hydrochloride alone, and 50/50 (100%) with the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride. 


Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridewas evaluated for treatment of acute, uncomplicated malaria caused by 


P. falciparum in 8 phase III randomized, open-label, controlled clinical trials (N = 1,030 enrolled in both treatment goups). The mean age of subjects was 27 years and 16% were children =12 years of age; 74% of subjects were male. Evaluable patients included those whose outcome at 28 days was known. Among 471 evaluable patients treated with the equivalent of 4atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tabletsonce daily for 3 days, 464 had a sensitive response (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) (Table 6). Seven patients had a response of RI resistance (elimination of parasitemia but with recurrent parasitemia between 7 and 28 days after starting treatment). In these trials, the response to treatment with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride was similar to treatment with the comparator drug in 4 trials.

Follow-up conducted in outpatients. d Study in pediatric patients 3 to 12 years of age. When these 8 trials were pooled and 2 additional trials evaulating atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride alone (without a comparator arm) were added to the analysis, the overall efficacy (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) in 521 evaluable patients was 98.7%. The efficacy ofatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride in the treatment of the erythrocytic phase of nonfalciparum malaria was assessed in a small number of patients. Of the 23 patients in Thailand infected with 


P. vivax and treated with atovaquone/proguanil hydrochloride 1,000 mg/400 mg daily for 3 days, parasitemia cleared in 21 (91.3%) at 7 days. Parasite relapse occurred commonly when 


P. vivax malaria was treated with atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride alone. Relapsing malarias including 


P. vivax and 


P. ovale require additional treatment to prevent relapse. 


The efficacy of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride in treating acute uncomplicated 


P. falciparum malaria in children weighing =5 and <11 kg was examined in an open-label, randomized trial conducted in Gabon. Patients received either atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (2 or 3atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride Pediatric Tablets once daily depending upon body weight) for 3 days (n = 100) or amodiaquine (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 days (n = 100). In this study, the MALARONE Tablets were crushed and mixed with condensed milk just prior to administration. An adequate clinical response (elimination of parasitemia with no recurrent parasitemia during follow-up for 28 days) was obtained in 95% (87/92) of the evaluable pediatric patients who receivedatovaquone and proguanil hydrochlorideand in 53% (41/78) of those evaluable who received amodiaquine. A response of RI resistance (elimination of parasitemia but with recurrent parasitemia between 7 and 28 days after starting treatment) was noted in 3% and 40% of the patients, respectively. Two cases of RIII resistance (rising parasite count despite therapy) were reported in the patients receivingatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride . There were 4 cases of RIII in the amodiaquine arm.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of atovaquone and/or proguanil hydrochloride in pregnant women. Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Falciparum malaria carries a higher risk of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women than in the general population. Maternal death and fetal loss are both known complications of falciparum malaria in pregnancy. In pregnant women who must travel to malaria-endemic areas, personal protection against mosquito bites should always be employed in addition to antimalarials.

"1010","091211","Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride, interfere with 2 different pathways involved in the biosynthesis of pyrimidines required for nucleic acid replication. Atovaquone is a selective inhibitor of parasite mitochondrial electron transport.

Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase in the malaria parasite disrupts deoxythymidylate synthesis. ","MECHANISM OF ACTION SECTION"
"1011","091211","No trials of the pharmacodynamics ofatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridehave been conducted. ","PHARMACODYNAMICS SECTION"
"1012","091211","Absorption: Atovaquone is a highly lipophilic compound with low aqueous solubility. The bioavailability of atovaquone shows considerable inter-individual variability. 


Dietary fat taken with atovaquone increases the rate and extent of absorption, increasing AUC 2 to 3 times and C


max 5 times over fasting. The absolute bioavailability of the tablet formulation of atovaquone when taken with food is 23%. Atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride tablets should be taken with food or a milky drink. 


Distribution: Atovaquone is highly protein bound (>99%) over the concentration range of 1 to 90 mcg/mL. A population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the apparent volume of distribution of atovaquone (V/F) in adult and pediatric patients after oral administration is approximately 8.8 L/kg. 


Proguanil is 75% protein bound. A population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that the apparent V/F of proguanil in adult and pediatric patients >15 years of age with body weights from 31 to 110 kg ranged from 1,617 to 2,502 L. In pediatric patients =15 years of age with body weights from 11 to 56 kg, the V/F of proguanil ranged from 462 to 966 L.In human plasma, the binding of atovaquone and proguanil was unaffected by the presence of the other. Metabolism: In a study where 


14C-labeled atovaquone was administered to healthy volunteers, greater than 94% of the dose was recovered as unchanged atovaquone in the feces over 21 days. There was little or no excretion of atovaquone in the urine (less than 0.6%). There is indirect evidence that atovaquone may undergo limited metabolism; however, a specific metabolite has not been identified. Between 40% to 60% of proguanil is excreted by the kidneys. Proguanil is metabolized to cycloguanil (primarily via CYP2C19) and 4-chlorophenylbiguanide. The main routes of elimination are hepatic biotransformation and renal excretion. 


Elimination: The elimination half-life of atovaquone is about 2 to 3 days in adult patients. 


The elimination half-life of proguanil is 12 to 21 hours in both adult patients and pediatric patients, but may be longer in individuals who are slow metabolizers. A population pharmacokinetic analysis in adult and pediatric patients showed that the apparent clearance (CL/F) of both atovaquone and proguanil are related to the body weight. The values CL/F for both atovaquone and proguanil in subjects with body weight =11 kg are shown in Table 2.Table 2.

The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone and proguanil in patients with body weight below 11 kg have not been adequately characterized. Pediatrics: The pharmacokinetics of proguanil and cycloguanil are similar in adult patients and pediatric patients. However, the elimination half-life of atovaquone is shorter in pediatric patients (1 to 2 days) than in adult patients (2 to 3 days). In clinical trials, plasma trough concentrations of atovaquone and proguanil in pediatric patients weighing 5 to 40 kg were within the range observed in adults after dosing by body weight.


Geriatrics: In a single-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil were compared in 13 elderly subjects (age 65 to 79 years) to 13 younger subjects (age 30 to 45 years). In the elderly subjects, the extent of systemic exposure (AUC) of cycloguanil was increased (point estimate = 2.36, 90% CI = 1.70, 3.28). T


max was longer in elderly subjects (median 8 hours) compared with younger subjects (median 4 hours) and average elimination half-life was longer in elderly subjects (mean 14.9 hours) compared with younger subjects (mean 8.3 hours). 


Renal Impairment: In patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min), oral clearance and/or AUC data for atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil are within the range of values observed in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min). In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min), mean oral clearance for proguanil was reduced by approximately 35% compared with patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance >80 mL/min) and the oral clearance of atovaquone was comparable between patients with normal renal function and mild renal impairment. No data exist on the use ofatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridefor long-term prophylaxis (over 2 months) in individuals with moderate renal failure. In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 mL/min), atovaquone C


max and AUC are reduced but the elimination half-lives for proguanil and cycloguanil are prolonged, with corresponding increases in AUC, resulting in the potential of drug accumulation and toxicity with repeated dosing 


[see Contraindications (

. 


Hepatic Impairment: In a single-dose study, the pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil were compared in 13 subjects with hepatic impairment (9 mild, 4 moderate, as indicated by the Child-Pugh method) to 13 subjects with normal hepatic function. In subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment as compared to healthy subjects, there were no marked differences (<50%) in the rate or extent of systemic exposure of atovaquone. However, in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, the elimination half-life of atovaquone was increased (point estimate = 1.28, 90% CI = 1.00 to 1.63). Proguanil AUC, C


max, and its elimination half-life increased in subjects with mild hepatic impairment when compared to healthy subjects (Table 3). Also, the proguanil AUC and its elimination half-life increased in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment when compared to healthy subjects. Consistent with the increase in proguanil AUC, there were marked decreases in the systemic exposure of cycloguanil (C

There were few measurable cycloguanil concentrations in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of atovaquone, proguanil, and cycloguanil after administration ofatovaquone and proguanil hydrochloridehave not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Drug Interactions: There are no pharmacokinetic interactions between atovaquone and proguanil at the recommended dose. 


Atovaquone is highly protein bound (>99%) but does not displace other highly protein-bound drugs in vitro. Proguanil is metabolized primarily by CYP2C19. Potential pharmacokinetic interactions between proguanil or cycloguanil and other drugs that are CYP2C19 substrates or inhibitors are unknown. Rifampin/Rifabutin: Concomitant administration of rifampin or rifabutin is known to reduce atovaquone concentrations by approximately 50% and 34%, respectively. The mechanisms of these interactions are unknown. 


Tetracyline: Concomitant treatment with tetracycline has been associated with approximately a 40% reduction in plasma concentrations of atovaquone. 


Metoclopramide: Concomitant treatment with metoclopramide has been associated with decreased bioavailability of atovaquone. 


Indinavir: Concomitant administration of atovaquone (750 mg BID with food for 14 days) and indinavir (800 mg TID without food for 14 days) did not result in any change in the steady-state AUC and C


max of indinavir but resulted in a decrease in the C


trough of indinavir (23% decrease [90% CI = 8%, 35%]).

"1014","091211","Genotoxicity studies have not been performed with atovaquone in combination with proguanil. Effects ofatovaquone and proguanil hydrochlorideon male and female reproductive performance are unknown. Atovaquone: A 24-month carcinogenicity study in CD rats was negative for neoplasms at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day corresponding to approximately 54 times the average steady-state plasma concentrations in humans during prophylaxis of malaria. In CD-1 mice, a 24-month study showed treatment-related increases in incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma at all doses tested (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day) which correlated with at least 15 times the average steady-state plasma concentrations in humans during prophylaxis of malaria. 


Atovaquone was negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames 


Salmonella mutagenicity assay, the Mouse Lymphoma mutagenesis assay, and the Cultured Human Lymphocyte cytogenetic assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the in vivo Mouse Micronucleus assay. 


Atovaquone did not impair fertility in male and female rats at doses up to 1,000 mg/kg/day corresponding to plasma exposures of approximately 7.3 times the estimated human exposure during treatment of malaria based on AUC. Proguanil: No evidence of a carcinogenic effect was observed in 24-month studies conducted in CD-1 mice at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.5 times the average human plasma exposure during prophylaxis of malaria based on AUC, and in Wistar Hannover rats at doses up 20 mg/kg/day corresponding to 1.1 times the average human plasma exposure during prophylaxis of malaria based on AUC. 


Proguanil was negative with or without metabolic activation in the Ames 


Salmonella mutagenicity assay and the Mouse Lymphoma mutagenesis assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the in vivo Mouse Micronucleus assay. 


Cycloguanil, the active metabolite of proguanil, was also negative in the Ames test, but was positive in the Mouse Lymphoma assay and the Mouse Micronucleus assay. These positive effects with cycloguanil, a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, were significantly reduced or abolished with folinic acid supplementation. A fertility study in Sprague-Dawley rats revealed no adverse effects at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day of proguanil hydrochloride (up to 0.04-times the average human exposure during treatment of malaria based on AUC). Fertility studies of proguanil in animals at exposures similar to or greater than those observed in humans have not been conducted.","CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY SECTION"
